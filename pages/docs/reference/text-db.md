# The `text.db` format

An indexed dictionary is an SQLite 3 database, `text.db`, with an optional
second database for its media pack, `media.db`. This page specifies both, for
programs that read or write them.

``` text title="one library folder"
~/.wudict/db/Webster/
  text.db          articles and indexes
  media.db         media pack: images and audio (optional)
  media.link.db    a cache; can be deleted      (optional)
  info.txt         source and build details
  res/             resource overrides           (optional)
```

`text.db` alone is a complete dictionary; the other files are optional or
derived.

`PRAGMA user_version` is **1**; wudict does not open a database with another
value. Tables have been added without changing it (see
[Compatibility](#compatibility)), so a reader must check that a table exists
before using it.

## Schema

``` sql title="text.db"
PRAGMA user_version = 1;

CREATE TABLE meta(key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT);

CREATE TABLE entry(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                   w  TEXT NOT NULL,          -- display headword
                   m  TEXT NOT NULL);         -- article body (see below)
CREATE INDEX idx_entry_w ON entry(w COLLATE NOCASE);

CREATE TABLE alias(w        TEXT    NOT NULL, -- an alternative spelling
                   entry_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES entry(id));
CREATE INDEX idx_alias_w ON alias(w COLLATE NOCASE);

CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE entry_fts USING fts5(    -- rowid = entry.id
    w, txt, content='', columnsize=0,
    tokenize='unicode61 remove_diacritics 2');

CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE entry_trigram USING fts5(-- only with the contains index
    w, content='', columnsize=0, tokenize='trigram');
```

`entry` holds the whole dictionary. The other tables are indexes and can be
rebuilt from it.

### Reading articles

`entry.m` is **either plain HTML text or a DEFLATE-compressed BLOB**, decided
per row by its first byte:

| First byte | What the row holds |
| --- | --- |
| `0x00` | raw DEFLATE stream, starting at byte 1 |
| anything else | the article HTML itself, as text |

Article HTML never begins with NUL. Both forms occur in the same table — short articles (under 120 bytes) and ones that
did not compress are stored literally — so **a reader must handle both**.

``` python title="one row, either form"
import sqlite3, zlib

db = sqlite3.connect("file:text.db?mode=ro", uri=True)
for w, m in db.execute("SELECT w, m FROM entry ORDER BY id"):
    blob = m if isinstance(m, bytes) else m.encode()
    html = zlib.decompress(blob[1:], -15).decode() if blob[:1] == b"\x00" \
           else blob.decode()
    print(w, html[:80])
```

`-15` is raw DEFLATE with no zlib or gzip header — `zlib.decompress(blob[1:])`
without it will fail.

Each row is compressed on its own, without a shared dictionary, so any row can
be read alone. [`NO_COMPRESS`](configuration.md#no_compress) turns compression
off for dictionaries indexed afterwards; reading handles both forms.

### Headwords, aliases and sub-entries

- **`entry.w`** is the headword as it is displayed. Lookups compare
  `COLLATE NOCASE`, which is the collation both indexes are built with.
- **`alias`** holds every other spelling that must find this entry: StarDict
  `.syn` entries, MDX `@@@LINK` redirects, Slob aliases, DSL variant
  headwords. Redirects are resolved during indexing: an alias always
  points at an existing `entry.id`, never at another alias.
- A headword beginning with **`@`** (`@examples_woman`) is an MDict-style
  **sub-entry**: a fragment an article pulls in by link, never a word. It stays
  reachable by exact lookup, is excluded from browsing and contains search,
  and is *not* counted in `meta.entry_count` (`meta.sub_entries` counts them).
  Exporters should normally skip `w LIKE '@_%'`.

### The search indexes

Both FTS5 tables are **contentless** (`content=''`) and keyed by
`rowid = entry.id`; they hold no text that needs exporting.

| Table | Column | Holds | Present when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `entry_fts` | `w` | the headword | always |
| `entry_fts` | `txt` | the article with tags stripped | with the full-text index; otherwise `''` |
| `entry_trigram` | `w` | the **folded** headword | with the contains index |

*Folded* means lowercased, NFD-normalised, with combining marks dropped — so
`Café` is indexed as `cafe`. `meta.fold_version` records the rules used; a
mismatch marks the contains index outdated and does not affect the articles.

`entry_fts` exists in every `text.db`: accent-insensitive exact and prefix
lookup use it.

## `meta`

A flat key/value table. Unknown keys must be ignored; absent keys must be
treated as empty rather than as an error.

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | **The title shown to the reader.** |
| `description` | **The text under *About this dictionary*.** Plain text or a small HTML fragment; a tag marks it as HTML. |
| `format` | Where it came from: `mdx`, `stardict`, `slob`, `dsl`, `bgl`, `zim`, … |
| `entry_count` | Entries excluding sub-entries |
| `sub_entries` | How many `@`-prefixed fragments there are |
| `ingest_level` | `text` = article text is indexed, `headwords` = only headwords |
| `has_trigram` | `1` when `entry_trigram` was built (still feature-detect the table) |
| `body_encoding` | `deflate` or `plain` — a note for humans; the read path decides per row |
| `dict_uuid` | 32 hex characters; what pairs this file with its `media.db` |
| `index_lang`, `contents_lang` | Languages, only when the source declared them |
| `source_path`, `source_size`, `source_mtime`, `source_sha256_1M` | The dictionary file it was indexed from, for detecting changes |
| `created` | RFC 3339, UTC |
| `fold_version`, `markup_version` | Which text-folding and article-markup rules built this file |

`name` and `description` are HTML-unescaped on the way out, so a title stored
as `A &amp; B` displays as `A & B`.

## Article HTML

Bodies are stored **as the dictionary wrote them**, converted to HTML where
the source format was not HTML. In particular, references to media are left in
their original spelling:

``` html
<img src="pictures/lion.jpg">
<a href="sound://lion.mp3">🔊</a>
```

wudict rewrites them to `/res/<dictionary id>/…` when it serves an article, not
in the database. An exporter gets the original names and looks each one up in
`media.db` (below) or beside the dictionary file.

## `media.db`

Written when the media pack is added. Same conventions and `user_version` as
`text.db`.

``` sql title="media.db"
PRAGMA user_version = 1;
CREATE TABLE meta(key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value TEXT);   -- dict_uuid, name, format
CREATE TABLE resource(name TEXT PRIMARY KEY, mime TEXT, data BLOB);
```

- `resource.name` is the name as articles reference it. A name is matched
  exactly, then case-insensitively, then in both Unicode normalization forms:
  MDX stores resource names in lower case, loose files keep their spelling, and
  an article may use either.
- `resource.data` is the file's bytes, not compressed by wudict.
- `meta.dict_uuid` **must** equal the `dict_uuid` in the `text.db` beside it.
  A mismatched pair is refused.

`media.link.db` caches where media is located inside the dictionary files. It
is derived, need not be copied, and can be deleted.

## Exporting

Without SQL:

``` sh title="whole dictionary as CSV, pyglossary layout"
wudict dump -o out ~/.wudict/db/Webster
```

This writes `out/Webster.csv`: `"#key","value"` metadata rows, then one row
per entry (headword, article, alternative headwords), with resources in
`Webster.csv_res`. [pyglossary](https://github.com/ilius/pyglossary) converts
this layout to any format it supports.

The complete dictionary, with SQL:

``` sql title="entries with their alternative spellings"
SELECT e.id, e.w, e.m,
       (SELECT group_concat(a.w, char(10)) FROM alias a WHERE a.entry_id = e.id) AS aliases
FROM entry e
WHERE e.w NOT LIKE '@_%'          -- skip sub-entry fragments
ORDER BY e.id;
```

Decode `m` as shown [above](#reading-articles). Open the file read-only
(`file:…?mode=ro`) while wudict may be running.

## Authoring a dictionary directly

A `text.db` written by another program is a wudict dictionary. Put its folder
in the library or in a dictionary folder.

Requirements:

- [x] `PRAGMA user_version = 1`.
- [x] Create `entry`, `alias` **and** `entry_fts` even for a headwords-only
      dictionary; leave `entry_fts.txt` as `''` when you do not index text.
- [x] Create both indexes exactly as shown, with **`COLLATE NOCASE`**; otherwise
      SQLite does not use them and every lookup scans the table.
- [x] `entry_trigram` stores the *folded* headword, not the raw one.
- [x] Bodies may be stored uncompressed.
- [x] Set `meta.name` and `meta.description`: they are the title and the
      *About this dictionary* text.
- [x] Set `meta.dict_uuid` (16 random bytes, hex) if you also write a
      `media.db`, and put the same value in both.
- [x] Leave out `meta.source_path`. If it names an existing file, wudict takes
      the About text from that file and ignores `description`.
- [x] Write to a temporary file and rename it into place, so an incomplete
      database is never found.

`meta.format` is a free label. Use your own (`native`), not `dsl` or
`stardict`: wudict treats those as built by itself and may offer to rebuild
them.

## Compatibility

- `user_version` stays at 1. Tables have been added without changing it
  (`entry_trigram`); check that a table exists before using it:
  `SELECT count(*) FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name='entry_trigram'`.
- Unknown `meta` keys are ignored, so you can add your own.
- A database without an optional index opens with fewer search modes.
- FTS5 is required: an SQLite build without it cannot open a `text.db`. The trigram tokenizer needs SQLite 3.34 or newer.
