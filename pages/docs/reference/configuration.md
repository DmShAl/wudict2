title: Configuration
description: Every wudict setting - flag, environment variable, wudict.toml key, values and default.
---

# Configuration

Each setting can be given as a command-line flag, an environment variable or a
key in `wudict.toml`. The variable and the key have the same name.

## Priority

Highest first: command-line flag, environment variable, `wudict.toml`, built-in
default. The setup page shows which values a flag or variable overrides.

## Config file

wudict reads the first of:

1. `--config` or `CONFIG_PATH`
2. `wudict.toml` next to the executable ([portable mode](#portable-mode))
3. `~/.wudict/wudict.toml`
4. `/etc/wudict/wudict.toml`

The first `wudict serve` creates `~/.wudict/wudict.toml` with every setting
commented out. Each start prints the file in effect. An unknown key is reported
at startup and on the setup page.

### Portable mode

A `wudict.toml` next to the executable takes precedence over
`~/.wudict/wudict.toml` and receives the settings saved from the setup page.
wudict never creates it.

## Files

| Platform | Config folder |
| --- | --- |
| macOS, Linux | `~/.wudict` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\.wudict` |
| Android | `Android/data/com.dmshepeta.wudict2/files` |

| In the config folder | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `wudict.toml` | settings |
| `state.json` | dictionary order, enabled dictionaries, display preferences; written by wudict |
| `groups.ini` | picker groups, once edited |
| `style/` | custom styles |
| `token` | the access key |
| `lemmas/` | installed lemma data ([`LEMMA_DIR`](#lemma_dir)) |
| `db/` | the library ([`DB_DIR`](#db_dir)) |

Log when there is no console: macOS `~/Library/Logs/wudict.log`, Linux
`~/.wudict/wudict.log`, Windows `%LOCALAPPDATA%\wudict\wudict.log`, Android
logcat.

wudict does not modify dictionary files. Only <kbd>🗑 Remove…</kbd> and
`wudict rm` delete them.

## Everyday settings

### DICT_DIR

Folders with dictionary files, subfolders included.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | `--dict-dir <path>`, repeated for several folders |
| Default | `~/Dictionaries` |

``` sh title="two folders, from the command line and the environment"
wudict --dict-dir ~/Dictionaries --dict-dir /Volumes/Ext/Dicts
DICT_DIR="~/Dictionaries:/Volumes/Ext/Dicts" wudict     # ";" on Windows
```

``` toml title="~/.wudict/wudict.toml"
DICT_DIR = ["~/Dictionaries", "/Volumes/Ext/Dicts"]
```

In `wudict.toml` several folders are an array; in the environment they are
separated by `:` (`;` on Windows). A dictionary found in two folders is listed
once, from the first. A missing folder is reported; the others are still read.

### DB_DIR

The library: one library folder per indexed dictionary.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | `--db-dir <path>` |
| Default | `~/.wudict/db` |

Must not be a `DICT_DIR` folder; wudict does not start if it is.

### SERVER_IP and SERVER_PORT

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flags | `--ip <address>`, `--port <port>` |
| Defaults | `127.0.0.1`, `6888` |

`127.0.0.1` is the loopback address, reachable from your machine only. Set
`0.0.0.0` to accept connections from your network. Requests from the network
then need the access key ([`AUTH`](#auth)), and deleting a dictionary from
another host also needs [`ALLOW_REMOTE_DELETE`](#allow_remote_delete).

### NO_BROWSER

Do not open a browser tab at startup.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | `--no-browser` |
| Default | off: a tab opens |

### AUTO_INDEX

Index each dictionary's headwords in the background on its first search.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | none, environment and file only |
| Values | `on`, `off` |
| Default | `on` |

`off`: dictionaries stay not indexed and are searched through their own format.
The contains index, full-text index and media pack are per-dictionary choices
either way.

[The library](../dictionaries/library.md){ .md-button }

### USE_CACHED

Also list indexed dictionaries whose dictionary files are gone.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | `--use-cached` |
| Default | off |

The setup page sets it with <kbd>Use these dictionaries</kbd>.

### ALLOW_REMOTE_DELETE

Allows clients on other hosts to delete dictionaries (<kbd>🗑 Remove…</kbd>,
`DELETE /api/library`).

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | `--allow-remote-delete <0\|1>` |
| Default | `0` |

Requests from the loopback address can always delete.

!!! warning "Deletion is permanent"

    Deleted files are unlinked, not moved to the Trash or the Recycle Bin.
    `wudict rm` without `-f` lists what it would delete.

### VERBOSE

Log requests, dictionary opens, indexing and audio conversion.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | `--verbose` |
| Default | off |

Applies to every command. `-v` is `--version`.

## Audio

### SPEEX_BACKEND

Which decoder converts `.spx` audio to WAV.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | none, environment and file only |
| Values | `internal` (built-in libspeex), `external` (the `speexdec` program) |
| Default | `internal` |

`internal` needs a `-cgo` build; a `-purego` build always uses `external`.

### SPEEXDEC

Path to the `speexdec` program.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | `--speexdec <path>` |
| Default | next to the executable, then on `PATH` |

The decoder in use is printed at startup.

## Desktop integration

### TRAY

Tray icon (Windows) or menu-bar icon (macOS).

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flags | `--tray`, `--no-tray` |
| Values | `1` always, `0` never, unset for automatic |
| Default | unset: shown only when started from the desktop |

Given both flags, `--no-tray` applies.

## Tuning

These settings change speed and memory use. Only `SEARCH_MEMORY` changes search
results.

### INDEX_WORKERS

How many dictionaries are indexed at the same time.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | `--index-workers <n>` |
| Values | a number; `auto` or `0`: one per CPU core |
| Default | `1` |

Indexing one dictionary fully uses one CPU core and a few hundred bytes of
memory per headword.

### PREVIEW_MEMORY

Memory that dictionaries not yet indexed may hold open.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | none, environment and file only |
| Values | a size such as `1GB`; `0`: no limit |
| Default | `1GB`; Android: a third of [`MEMORY_LIMIT`](#memory_limit) |

An open dictionary that is not indexed holds about 350 bytes per headword.
Above the limit, the least recently used are closed. Indexed dictionaries are
read from disk and do not count.

### SEARCH_MEMORY

Memory one search may use to open dictionaries that are not indexed.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | none, environment and file only |
| Values | a size such as `512MB`; `0`: no limit |
| Default | `0`; Android: the value of `MEMORY_LIMIT` |

Past the limit, the remaining dictionaries are reported as *not searched*.
Indexed dictionaries and a search of one dictionary are not limited.

### MEMORY_LIMIT

A soft memory limit for the whole process.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | none, environment and file only |
| Values | a size such as `4GB`; `0`: none |
| Default | none; Android: 1/16 of the device's RAM, between 192 MiB and 384 MiB |

Near the limit, the Go runtime collects garbage more often and wudict drops its
caches; the process can still exceed it.

### NO_COMPRESS

Store article text uncompressed.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | `--no-compress` |
| Default | off: article text is DEFLATE-compressed |

The library becomes about 3 times larger; reads are slightly faster.

## Lemmatization

With lemma data for a language, a search for an inflected form finds the lemma:
`knew` → *know*, `fuiste` → *ser*, `идет` → *идти*. See
[Search → Inflected words](../start/search.md#inflected-words).

**Lemmatization needs the dictionary's language.** wudict takes the first it
finds of:

1. the language the dictionary declares: Lingvo DSL (`#INDEX_LANGUAGE`),
   Babylon, ZIM, wudict markdown;
2. a language code or English language name at the start of the file name:
   `es-en-collins.mdx`, `spa-eng-oxford.mdx`, `spanish-collins.mdx`;
3. a folder inside a dictionary folder whose whole name is a language code or
   English language name: `es/`, `Spanish/`;
4. a language named in the dictionary's title: *Dahl's Russian Dictionary*,
   *(Ru-Ru)*;
5. otherwise English.

English dictionaries therefore need no renaming.

### MORPH_CACHE

How many languages of lemma data stay in memory.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | none, environment and file only |
| Values | a number; `0` turns lemmatization off |
| Default | `2`; Android: `1` |

A language is loaded on the first search that needs it; above the limit the
least recently used is unloaded. A loaded language uses 1 MB (Persian) to 90 MB
(Slovak); English 7 MB. `wudict lemmas list` shows each.

### LEMMA_DIR

The folder of installed lemma data. English is built in.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | none, environment and file only |
| Values | a folder |
| Default | `~/.wudict/lemmas` |

Install languages with <kbd>Lemmatization…</kbd> (dictionary panel → folder
summary) or [`wudict lemmas download`](cli.md#lemmas). The folder is read at
startup and after each install or removal on the Lemmatization page; a file
added by hand or with `wudict lemmas` is read after a restart.

??? info "Lemma data file format"

    One file per language, named by its code or English name: `pl.txt`,
    `pol.tsv`, `polish.txt.gz`. Extension `.txt` or `.tsv`, optionally
    gzip-compressed; other files are ignored. Each line is a lemma followed by
    its forms, tab-separated, in lower case:

    ```
    kot	kota	kotu	kotem	koty	kotów
    pies	psa	psu	psem	psy	psów
    ```

    The lists of
    [michmech/lemmatization-lists](https://github.com/michmech/lemmatization-lists)
    (one lemma–form pair per line) work as downloaded. Malformed lines are
    skipped. An `en` file replaces the built-in English.

### LEMMA_URL

The catalogue lemma data is installed from.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | `-url` on the `wudict lemmas` commands |
| Values | a URL, or the path of a `manifest.json` |
| Default | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wuweidict/lemmas/main/manifest.json` |

Used by `wudict lemmas` and the Lemmatization page. A local path installs
without a network, e.g. from a copy of the catalogue repository:

``` sh
wudict lemmas download -url /media/usb/lemmas/manifest.json ru sk
```

Each file is checked against the SHA-256 digest in the catalogue.

The lemma data is published under the
[ODbL](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/) and derived from
[michmech/lemmatization-lists](https://github.com/michmech/lemmatization-lists);
see `ATTRIBUTION.txt` in the catalogue repository.

## Import

Settings for installing dictionaries from a file or a link on the setup page.

### IMPORT_KEEP

What happens to an archive after its dictionaries are installed.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | none, environment and file only |
| Values | `ask`, `keep`, `delete` |
| Default | `ask` |

A failed import always keeps the archive.

### IMPORT_URL_HOSTS

The hosts an archive may be downloaded from. A host matches itself and its
subdomains.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | none, environment and file only |
| Default | blank: any host |

``` toml
IMPORT_URL_HOSTS = ["example.org", "cloud.example.net"]
```

In the environment the hosts are comma-separated.

Set it when the server listens on the network: otherwise a client there can
make this machine download from any address it can reach.

### IMPORT_INSECURE

Also allow plain `http://` links and hosts on the local network.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | none, environment and file only |
| Values | `0`, `1` |
| Default | `0`: `https://` only, public hosts only |

## Access

### AUTH

Whether a request must carry the access key.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | none, environment and file only |
| Values | `auto`, `on`, `off` |
| Default | `auto`: required when [`SERVER_IP`](#server_ip-and-server_port) is not `127.0.0.1` |

The key is a random string stored in `~/.wudict/token`, readable only by your
user. `wudict token` prints a link that carries it
(`http://<address>:<port>/?k=<key>`); opening the link once stores the key in
that browser as a cookie. Scripts send `Authorization: Bearer <key>`.
`wudict token -rotate` replaces the key, and every browser and script holding
the old one must be given the new link.

The three endpoints open to browser extensions (`/api/dicts`, `/api/search`,
`/res/`) do not need the key.

`off` on a network address gives anyone who can reach the port your library,
your settings and your folder names.

### AUTH_TOKEN

The access key itself, when it comes from elsewhere: a password manager, a
container secret. Overrides `~/.wudict/token` and is never written to it.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | none, environment and file only |
| Default | the contents of `~/.wudict/token` |

### TRUSTED_HOSTS

Host names the server answers to, in addition to `localhost`. Requests to an IP
address are always accepted.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | none, environment and file only |
| Default | blank: IP addresses and `localhost` only |

``` toml
TRUSTED_HOSTS = ["wudict.lan"]
```

A request naming any other host is refused with `421 Misdirected Request`. This
blocks DNS rebinding: a web page that points its own domain at your machine
cannot read the server through it. Set it for a reverse proxy or a host name
you gave the machine; `"*"` turns the check off.

### BROWSER_EXTENSIONS

Browser extensions allowed to call the server.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | none, environment and file only |
| Default | blank: any installed extension |

``` toml title="allow one extension only"
BROWSER_EXTENSIONS = ["chrome-extension://abcdefghijklmnopabcdefghijklmnop"]
```

An extension can call three read-only endpoints: `/api/dicts`, `/api/search`
and `/res/`. Firefox assigns a new `moz-extension://` origin to each
installation, so a list cannot name a Firefox extension in advance.

### WEB_ORIGINS

Web page origins allowed to call the server from JavaScript.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | none, environment and file only |
| Default | blank: none |

``` toml title="allow two origins"
WEB_ORIGINS = ["http://localhost:3000", "https://notes.example.com"]
```

A listed origin can call the same three endpoints as an extension.

An origin is a scheme (`http` or `https`), a host and a port, without a path:
`http://localhost:3000`, not `http://localhost:3000/app` or `localhost:3000`. A
different scheme or port is a different origin. A default port may be omitted:
`https://x.example` equals `https://x.example:443`.

`"*"` allows every origin: any page you visit can read your dictionaries while
the server runs. Use it only while developing; the startup output shows it:

``` text
  web origins   any website may read your dictionaries (WEB_ORIGINS = "*")
```

Programs outside a browser (curl, scripts, applications) are not subject to
this setting. What limits them is [`SERVER_IP`](#server_ip-and-server_port) and
the access key ([`AUTH`](#auth)).

## CONFIG_PATH

The config file to read, instead of the search order under
[Config file](#config-file).

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | `--config <path>` |
| Default | unset |

A flag and an environment variable only; not a key in `wudict.toml`.

## Example

``` toml title="~/.wudict/wudict.toml"
DICT_DIR      = ["~/Dictionaries", "/data/dicts"]
SERVER_IP     = "0.0.0.0"          # listen on the network: AUTH applies
SERVER_PORT   = "9000"
NO_BROWSER    = "1"
TRUSTED_HOSTS = ["wudict.lan"]
WEB_ORIGINS   = ["http://localhost:3000"]
```
