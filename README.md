# wuDict2 — an Android fork of WuWeiDict

**wuDict2** is an Android fork of [WuWeiDict](https://github.com/wuweidict/wudict)
("wuDict"): a fast, _native_, self-contained, multi-format dictionary server that
runs in your browser at [http://localhost:6888](http://localhost:6888).

What differs from upstream:

- Its own Android identity — launcher name **wuDict2** — so it installs and
  runs **beside** the upstream wuDict app.
- A different default server port, **6889** (upstream uses 6888), so both apps
  can run at the same time on one device.
- Android-focused UI work: an extended Appearance sheet (window background
  color and image, CSS presets as toggleable layers), a native folder picker,
  and ongoing reliability fixes.
- The Go server, the supported formats and the GPL-3.0-or-later license stay
  upstream-compatible; upstream copyright notices remain in place, and the files
  this fork authored carry its own — `Copyright (C) 2026 DmShAl (Shepeta
  Dmitry)`, under the same license.

Desktop builds and the general manual live in the
[upstream repository](https://github.com/wuweidict/wudict). To build the
Android app from source, see the
[Android build instructions](pages/docs/reference/building.md).

Runs on Android, macOS, Linux, Windows.

One native golang binary, no dependencies and minimum configuration — just set the folders with your `.mdx/.slob/.bgl/.zim/.ifo` dictionary collections, and you are good to go.

Runs natively on [android](https://wuweidict.github.io/wudict/apps/android/), [mac](https://wuweidict.github.io/wudict/apps/macos/), [windows](https://wuweidict.github.io/wudict/apps/windows/), [linux](https://wudict.legbehindneck.com/running/#__tabbed_1_2), and even raspberry pi.

## wuDict for Desktop

1. Download the standalone binary for your OS from
   [releases](https://github.com/wuweidict/wudict/releases), rename to `wudict`, 
   `chmod +x wudict` (macOS/Linux) and move to a folder in `$PATH`, e.g. `/usr/local/bin`.
2. Run `wudict` or `./wudict` if the file is in the current folder. For windows you can either use the installer [`wudict-windows-x64-setup-<x.y.z>.exe`](https://github.com/wuweidict/wudict/releases/latest), or download the standalone executable `wudict-windows-amd64-cgo.exe` and then double-click to run. For macOS an app bundle is provided  (it is not signed with a commercial Apple Developer Certificate, macOS flags it as unverified, and extra steps are needed to de-quarantine the app as described in the [manual](https://wuweidict.github.io/wudict/apps/macos/)).
3. By default `wudict` searches for dictionaries under `~/Dictionaries` (including subfolders); 
   if the dictionary folder is missing or empty, a setup page opens where you can configure your dictionary folders.

## Adding dictionaries 
With wuDict running, dictionary folders can be configured from [http://localhost:6888/setup](http://localhost:6888/setup). The browser setup page is a convenience 
for writing `DICT_DIR` in the configuration file at `~/.wudict/wudict.toml` and other actions, such as configuring lemmatization (morphology), installing dictionaries from a URL via drag-n-drop from the system file manager.

### Multiple dictionary folders

You can configure the dictionary folders from
the console via cli args, env vars or by directly editing the config file at `~/.wudict/wudict.toml` (recommended):
```sh
# as one or more CLI args (for example, as a temporary override of the current `wudict.toml`):
wudict --dict-dir ~/Dictionaries --dict-dir /Volumes/Data/Dicts   # repeat the flag

# or via an env var:
DICT_DIR="~/Dictionaries:/Volumes/Data/Dicts" wudict              # separate multiple folders with ":" on linux/mac and ";" on Windows
```

in `wudict.toml` (the recommended way):
```toml
DICT_DIR = ["~/Dictionaries", "/Volumes/Data/Dicts"]
```

## Searching

| Mode | What it does | Needs indexing? |
|---|---|---|
| **starts with** | exact matches, else headwords starting with the term (accent/case-insensitive) | no |
| **exact** | exact headword (accent/case-fold fallback: `corazon` → `corazón`) | no |
| **contains** | substring / typo-tolerant headword match, anywhere in the word (FTS5 trigram) | ad-hoc |
| **full-text** | search inside article text, ranked by relevance | yes |

Every dictionary works immediately for _starts-with_ and _exact_ lookups using
the native index. The first time you search **a small headword index
is prepared in the background** — a couple of MB — so accent-insensitive
lookups (*corazon* → *corazón*) work seamlessly (disable with `AUTO_INDEX=off`).

***Full-text*** (searching inside article text) and ***contains*** 
 (substring search) are not enabled by default as they consume more disk space. 
Click the <kbd>☰</kbd> button and enable them as needed.
For each dictionary the index size is displayed; *⚡ index all* adds full-text for all dictionaries
at once, and `wudict ingest [-fulltext] [-contains] [<file-or-folder>]` does the
same from the command line.

Results stream live as each dictionary responds — the top one opens
automatically. In the <kbd>☰</kbd> panel you can **reorder** dictionaries (drag the
⠿ handle or use the ▲▼⏫⏬ buttons) to set your preferred result order, and
**enable/disable** each one (the switch) to include or exclude it from
*All dictionaries* searches; both are remembered.
A dictionary that was disabled for *All dictionaries* searches can still 
be searched by selecting it in the dictionary dropdown.

> [!TIP]
> - Pressing <kbd>`/`</kbd> focuses the search box
> - double-click any word in an article to look it up
> - click links inside articles to follow cross-references
> - audio plays on click
> - <kbd>⊞</kbd> expands all results (<kbd>⊟</kbd> closes them again — for the current page only, never remembered)
> - <kbd>⇔</kbd> toggles a wide layout
> - <kbd>☀☾</kbd> cycles auto/light/dark theme. Search URLs are bookmarkable

## Run as an app (macOS)

For macOS you can either run the `wudict` binary from a terminal, or use the **`wudict-macos-universal-app-<version>.zip`** from [releases](https://github.com/wuweidict/wudict/releases) which wraps `wudict` into a macOS app bundle.

> [!WARNING]
> The macOS bundle is signed with an ad-hoc certificate therefore on first run the bundle has be de-quarantined with `/usr/bin/xattr -cr /Applications/wuDict.app` and then launched via righ-click → <kbd>**Open**</kbd>.

## Run wudict as a service (macOS)

`wudict` can be installed as a `launchctl` LaunchAgent using Makefile targets:

```sh
# run from project root
make mac-agent-install   # generate the plist from launchctl/*.plist.in, then:
make mac-agent-start     # launchctl bootstrap gui/$UID <plist>
make mac-agent-stop      # launchctl bootout   gui/$UID/com.legbehindneck.wudict
make mac-agent-restart   # rebuild, then launchctl kickstart -k gui/$UID/<label>
make mac-agent-status    # launchctl print    gui/$UID/<label>
make mac-agent-uninstall # stop it and delete the plist
```

## Run as an app (Windows)

In windows `wudict` runs from `cmd` or PowerShell as an ordinary
command-line program. When double-clicked, started from a shortcut, or by double-clicking 
a dictionary file, it hides the  console window, and shows a **tray icon** instead, logging to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\wudict\wudict.log`. See also [running on windows](https://wuweidict.github.io/wudict/apps/windows/).


## Run as a service (Linux)

On linux `wudict` can be installed as a **systemd user unit** — only copying the binary into
`/usr/local/bin` needs sudo, the service itself runs with user permissions and start/stop does not require sudo.
Unlike system services which are managed via `systemd start|stop|status <service-name>`, a user systemd service 
additionally requires the `--user` key, e.g. `systemd --user start|stop|status wudict`.

```sh
# from project root
make linux-service-install   # sudo-installs /usr/local/bin/wudict, then writes the user unit
make linux-service-start     # systemctl --user enable --now wudict.service
make linux-service-stop
make linux-service-restart   # rebuild, reinstall the binary, restart
make linux-service-status
make linux-service-uninstall # disable + remove the unit (keeps the binary)

make linux-install     # just the binary  (PREFIX=/opt/foo to relocate)
make linux-uninstall
```

The systemd unit assumes the executable is at `/usr/local/bin/wudict`.

To keep the service running when you are not logged in:

```sh
sudo loginctl enable-linger "$(id -un)"
```

## Configuration

Priority: **CLI flag > environment variable > wudict.toml > default**.
A commented `~/.wudict/wudict.toml` is generated on first run, and the
config file path is printed on startup.

| Flag | env / toml key | Default                       |
|---|---|-------------------------------|
| `--dict-dir` | `DICT_DIR` | `~/Dictionaries`              |
| `--db-dir` | `DB_DIR` | `~/.wudict/db`                |
| `--ip` | `SERVER_IP` | `127.0.0.1`                   |
| `--port` | `SERVER_PORT` | `6888`                        |
| `--config` | `CONFIG_PATH` | auto-detect                   |
| `--no-browser` | `NO_BROWSER=1` | open browser                  |
| `--verbose` | `VERBOSE=1` | detailed logging              |
| `--speexdec` | `SPEEXDEC` | found on `PATH`               |
| `--use-cached` | `USE_CACHED` | off                           |
| — | `AUTO_INDEX` | `on` (`off` to disable)       |
| `--no-compress` | `NO_COMPRESS` | off (article text compressed) |
| — | `BROWSER_EXTENSIONS` | any extension may look words up |

**`BROWSER_EXTENSIONS`** sets which browser extensions may use the `wudict` server. 
Blank (the default) lets any installed extension reach the read-only dictionary API — `/api/dicts`, `/api/search`,
`/res/`.

Restrict to only allow specific extensions:

```toml
BROWSER_EXTENSIONS = ["chrome-extension://bknaaoffefipfnpefmkbipcdemljbhjh"]
```

(Firefox generates a fresh `moz-extension://` id for every installation, so
there is no stable origin to pin there.)

See also: [chrome/firefox browser extension](https://wuweidict.github.io/wudict/extension/)

Config file search order: `--config` / `CONFIG_PATH`, then
`<exe-dir>/wudict.toml`, `~/.wudict/wudict.toml`,
`/etc/wudict/wudict.toml`.

**Portable mode.** A `wudict.toml` can also be placed in the same folder as the `wudict` (or `wudict.exe`) executable.

**`~/.wudict/state.json`** stores dictionary search order and enabled/disable state. 

## Command line

Run `wudict --help` for the full reference. 

> Examples:

```sh
wudict                                   # start the server (default command)

# start server with custom options
wudict --dict-dir ~/Dicts --port 9090    
wudict --dict-dir ~/Dicts --dict-dir /Volumes/Ext/Dicts   # several folders

# search for a word in a specific dictionary; plain text to stdout 
# optional, request specific format with: "-format=raw|clean|text"
wudict lookup ~/Dicts/Oxford.mdx water

# search ALL dictionaries in folder; plain text to stdout
wudict searchall -dict-dir /path/to/dicts flight

# index every dictionary in your configured folders (DICT_DIR), as the app does
wudict ingest

# index every dictionary in a given folder
wudict ingest ~/Dicts                    

# index + pack media
wudict ingest -full ~/Dicts/Oxford.mdx   

# clean leftover files
wudict clean

# list removable library items (-f deletes)

# list headwords (or keys) in a specific dictionary
wudict keys ~/Dicts/Oxford.mdx
wudict keys ~/Dicts/Oxford.mdd

# extract a resource (pass the key shown by `wudict keys ...`)
wudict res ~/Dicts/Oxford.mdd audio/a.mp3
```

For more on command line usage see the manual:
- [wuDict Command Line](https://wudict.legbehindneck.com/reference/cli/)

## Sharing dictionaries (one folder each)

Indexing a dictionary creates a corresponding folder under
`~/.wudict/db/` — the **library**:

```
~/.wudict/db/
  Oxford/
    text.db     articles + search indexes
    media.db    audio/images (only after "pack media")
    info.txt    what this is, where it came from
    res/        optional — files that override the dictionary's own original resources
```

A dictionary is one folder, so it moves as one thing: **copy, move or zip
it and share**. On the other machine, drop it into a dictionary
folder and it works — no original source files needed. a `text.db`
without its `media.db` still works (with no media). 
To generate the media pack click the <kbd>media</kbd> 
in the dictionary panel.

The <kbd>☰</kbd> panel shows each dictionary's provenance: the source file it came
from, and — expanded — the library folder holding its SQLite database files.
Click a path to copy it to clipboard.

At the foot of the panel, **Folders & configuration** shows which folders
are being scanned (with per-folder counts), where indexed dictionaries
are located, and which `wudict.toml` is in effect — with *Reveal in Finder* /
*Show in File Explorer* / *Open Containing Folder*, depending on your
system. <kbd>**Edit folders…**</kbd> opens the dictionary folders editor.

## Patching dictionary's files

Dictionaries can include their own stylesheets, scripts, images and audio. 
You can provide your own 'patched' versions 
by placing files in the `res/` subfolder in 
wudict's DB folder at `~/.wudict/db/<some-dict-name/res`. Files from `./res` 
take precedence over the original files from `.mdd`, `.slob`, `.dsl.files.zip` etc.

```
~/.wudict/db/Cambridge English Dictionary Online/
  text.db
  res/
    jquery.js          ← replaces the dictionary's own (damaged) copy
    js/entry.js        ← supplies one the dictionary never contained
    css/style.css
```

Subfolders must follow the same hierarchy as the original resources.
E.g. intermediary folders like `js/…` and `css/…` must mirror the path the article is referencing.

One exception: a `.spx` audio file placed in `res/` is served as-is,
**not** transcoded to WAV the way a `.spx` inside the dictionary is. Use `.mp3` or `.wav` instead.

## Custom styles

`res/` patches one file of one dictionary. To restyle **everything** — wudict
itself and every article — put your own CSS in two optional files beside the
`wudict.toml` in effect, usually `~/.wudict/style/`:

```
~/.wudict/style/
  app.css       wudict itself — its colours, its own layout
  article.css   what dictionaries render, in every article
```

The <kbd>☰</kbd> panel's **Custom styles…** opens an editor for app and article styles, docked at the
bottom of the page so you get live preview of your CSS changes as you type. 
A few presets are included — a compact mobile view, sepia, high contrast, true-black OLED, 
a wider column, justified text, normalized tables.

```css
/* app.css — sepia in light mode, page and definitions together */
html:not([data-dark]){
  --bg:#f4ecd8; --bg-card:#faf3e3;
  --fg:#3b3229; --line:#e0d5bd;
  --wd-article-bg:#faf3e3; --wd-article-fg:#3b3229;
}
```

```css
/* article.css — reclaim the side space a desktop dictionary reserves */
@media (max-width: 700px){
  :host, :root > body         { margin-inline:0 !important; padding-inline:0 !important }
  :host > *, :root > body > * { margin-inline:0 !important; padding-inline:0 !important }
}
```

To undo changes use <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd> 
(on windows <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Z</kbd>).
A dot on a tab means that box has unsaved changes. If a rogue CSS rule makes the app UI disappear, append `/?style=off` in the URL
and the page is served with default styles.

## Disk use

A prepared dictionary is usually **smaller than the original dictionary file**:
article bodies are compressed, and _full-text search_ and _contains_ indexes are only built on-demand.

| index type                                         | cost (40k-entry dictionary, 45.6 MB source) |
|----------------------------------------------------|---|
| regular search — exact, prefix, accent-insensitive | ~2 MB, always on |
| full-text search                                   | ~12 MB, one click |
| contains (substring)                               | ~2.4 MB, one click |
| packed media                                       | as large as the images/audio |

The <kbd>☰</kbd> panel shows these as switches per dictionary, with their real sizes —
click to add, click again to remove.

You can set in `~/.wudict/wudict.toml` the option `NO_COMPRESS = "1"` (or pass `--no-compress` from the CLI) to disable compression of article bodies —
this will make the indexes roughly 3x larger, and provide slightly faster reads. 
By default (e.g. `NO_COMPRESS = "0"`) article bodies are compressed with gzip.

## Speex audio (.spx)

Browsers cannot play Speex. wuDict internally transcodes
`.spx` audio to WAV and caches the result. 
If wuDict was built without the internal speex decoder (the purego flavours) 
then the external `speexdec` utility can be used (for mac: `brew install speex`, 
linux: `apt install speex`, etc).

## Building from source

Requires [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (and a C compiler for the
default cgo build):

```sh
make build          # native build (cgo sqlite, fastest) → ./wudict
make install        # install the binary into GOBIN
make check          # tidy + vet + tests
make cross          # all release platforms (pure-Go sqlite, no C toolchain)
make help           # every available target
```

`make` is preinstalled on macOS/linux, for windows get the `make-X.Y.Z-without-guile-w32-bin.zip` e.g. from 
[sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/) and extract `make.exe` to a folder in `%PATH%`.

Or with the Go toolchain alone:

```sh
# recommended flavour, the fastest (cgo sqlite + built-in speex), needs a C compiler
go install -tags sqlite_fts5 github.com/wuweidict/wudict@latest

# no C compiler? drop the tag — pure-Go sqlite, .spx audio via external speexdec
go install github.com/wuweidict/wudict@latest
```

Both produce a working `wudict`; the tag only chooses the SQLite driver.
Passing `-tags sqlite_fts5` on a machine without a C toolchain quietly
falls back to the pure-Go build rather than failing.

CI builds are generated with github actions — [`.github/workflows/build-cgo.yml`](.github/workflows/build-cgo.yml)
for the cgo flavour with internal speex decoder and optimized sqlite3, and
[`.github/workflows/build-purego.yml`](.github/workflows/build-purego.yml) for purego builds.
Supported OS's: macOS (arm64/amd64), Linux (amd64/arm64/armv7/armv6) and Windows
(amd64/arm64).

### Building the macOS bundle from source

> 💡A golang environment is required. See [Build from source](#build-from-source) above.

Run `make mac-app-install` from project root to build **wuDict.app** and install it to
`~/Applications` (no sudo, no admin prompt):

```sh
make mac-app            # dist/wuDict.app — universal-ready, ad-hoc signed
make mac-app-install    # copy it to ~/Applications (APP_DEST= to relocate)
```

The bundle is the same binary as console `wudict` which spawns no terminal window, and 
additionally adds a **menu-bar icon** with common actions. See more about [running on macOS](https://wuweidict.github.io/wudict/apps/macos/).


## Acknowledgements

Almost nothing here was invented by this project. Some of the formats `wudict` reads are open-source, others are
closed source, and they are available because other people spent years working
on dictionaries and tools to read, write and convert data in these formats.

### Prior art and format knowledge

- **[pyglossary](https://github.com/ilius/pyglossary)** — its plugins are the clearest working description of
  MDX/MDD, StarDict, Slob, DSL and BGL that exists anywhere, and the BGL parser
  in `wudict` is ported from `pyglossary`'s `babylon_bgl` plugin. Thanks to
  **[@ilius](https://github.com/ilius)** and pyglossary's contributors for
  sustained, meticulous work on formats nobody else kept maintaining.
- **[GoldenDict](http://goldendict.org/)** and the actively developed fork
  **[goldendict-ng](https://github.com/xiaoyifang/goldendict-ng)** — the program
  that made these dictionaries worth owning, and the model for the BGL reader's
  streaming decompression.
- **[medict](https://github.com/terasum/medict)** by Quan Chen (formerly
  `go-mdict`) — the MDX/MDD parser in `internal/gomdict` is derived from it.
- **Raul Fernandes** and **Karl Grill** — the original reverse engineering of the
  Babylon BGL format.
- **[slob](https://github.com/itkach/slob)** and Aard 2 by Igor Tkach,
  **[StarDict](https://github.com/huzheng001/stardict-3)**, ABBYY Lingvo's DSL,
  and **[Kiwix](https://kiwix.org/)**'s ZIM.

### Libraries and components

- **[SQLite](https://sqlite.org/)** and its
  **[FTS5](https://sqlite.org/fts5.html)** extension — the entire prepared
  library: storage, headword index, and full-text search across a hundred
  dictionaries at once. **FTS5** made this project possible. 
- Public domain, and maintained at that standard for twenty-five years.
- **[mattn/go-sqlite3](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3)** — cgo SQLite
  driver; the default optimized build.
- **[modernc.org/sqlite](https://gitlab.com/cznic/sqlite)** — SQLite translated
  to pure Go, so releases build for every platform without a C toolchain. Both
  drivers are first-class.
- **[Speex](https://www.speex.org/)** — Jean-Marc Valin and the
  [Xiph.Org Foundation](https://xiph.org/). `internal/speex` vendors the
  reference decoder so `.spx` pronunciations play without an external tool, and
  it includes **[kiss_fft](https://github.com/mborgerding/kissfft)** by Mark
  Borgerding.
- **[anchore/go-lzo](https://github.com/anchore/go-lzo)** — LZO1X
  decompression for MDX record blocks, written from the kernel's format
  documentation and **[lzokay](https://github.com/AxioDL/lzokay)** by Jack
  Andersen.
- **[c0mm4nd/go-ripemd](https://github.com/c0mm4nd/go-ripemd)** — RIPEMD, for
  MDX key-block decryption.
- **[cespare/xxhash](https://github.com/cespare/xxhash)** — MDX v3 checksums.
- **[klauspost/compress](https://github.com/klauspost/compress)** — zstd and
  deflate, for ZIM clusters and Slob bins.
- **[ulikunitz/xz](https://github.com/ulikunitz/xz)** — LZMA, for Slob and ZIM
  content.
- **[aaaton/golem](https://github.com/aaaton/golem)** — English lemmatiser, so
  that *understood* finds *understand*.
- **[golang.org/x/net](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/net)** — HTML tokeniser,
  used to rewrite article markup and resolve dictionary resources.
- **[gogpu/systray](https://github.com/gogpu/systray)** and
  **[godbus/dbus](https://github.com/godbus/dbus)** — the tray icon, and its
  Linux desktop integration.
- **[Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)** by Jordan Russell — the
  Windows installer: small, scriptable, and free for as long as Windows has had
  installers.
- **[Go](https://go.dev/)** — the stack that lets us cross-compiles a static binary for
  eight platforms from one machine, including android.
