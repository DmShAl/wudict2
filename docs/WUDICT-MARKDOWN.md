# wudict markdown — format specification, version 1

Normative (D154). The two examples of §10 are, byte for byte, `docs/wudict-markdown/examples/clean.wudict.md` and
`html.wudict.md`.

A wudict markdown file is **one dictionary in standard CommonMark**, plus GFM tables. Any stock
CommonMark renderer displays it correctly. Nothing in it needs a parser plugin: a dictionary reader only adds
the reading rules of §3 on top of the stock parse.

```
# Pocket English
wudict: 1
from: en
to: en

A small general-purpose English dictionary.

## run
## runs
## ran

*v.* /rʌn/

1. To move quickly on foot.
2. To operate or manage: *she runs a bakery*. Compare [walk](entry://walk).

## aesthetic

<div class="entry"><span class="pos">adj.</span> <span class="ipa">/iːsˈθɛtɪk/</span>
<div class="sense"><b>1</b> concerned with beauty</div></div>
```

## 1. Conventions

- MUST, SHOULD and MAY are used as in RFC 2119.
  - **Reader:** file → dictionary.
  - **Writer:** dictionary → file.
  - **Host:** the application that displays articles.
- **Markdown** means CommonMark 0.31.2 with raw HTML enabled, plus one GFM 0.29 extension: **tables** (§4.10). No
  other syntax has meaning in this format.
- An extension is used only where CommonMark has no readable equivalent. Tables qualify, because a raw `<table>`
  is impractical to edit by hand. Strikethrough does not, because inline `<del>` is standard CommonMark.
- **WS** is U+0020 or U+0009. **Trim** removes leading and trailing WS only.

## 2. File

- **R2.1** The file is UTF-8. Readers remove a leading BOM and turn CRLF and lone CR into LF. An invalid UTF-8
  sequence or U+0000 becomes U+FFFD.
- **R2.2** The file is named `<stem>.wudict.md` or a plain `<stem>.md` (compressed: R2.4). Whatever its name, a file
  is a dictionary only when its lines 1-2 are the title and the `wudict` field (R3.1): that field is the gate,
  and the name only nominates the file. A file that fails the gate is not a dictionary: a reader ignores it where
  it finds it (a folder, an archive), and reports why when it was asked to open that file. Writers write
  `.wudict.md`.
- **R2.3** Resources live beside the file, in a folder named like the file with its final `.md` replaced by
  `.files` (`<stem>.wudict.files/`, `<stem>.files/`), or in a zip archive of that name + `.zip`. Relative
  references in bodies resolve inside it and MUST NOT leave it.
- **R2.4** Packaging:
  - `<stem>.wudict.md.gz` is the file, gzip-compressed. Readers SHOULD read it, including concatenated members, and
    `.wudict.md.dz` (dictzip) as gzip.
  - Writers MAY write `.gz`, with mtime 0 and no name or comment.
  - Decompression MUST be bounded.
  - No other compression or archive belongs to version 1.
- **R2.5** Writers end the file with exactly one LF and write no trailing WS on any line, except inside HTML
  blocks and code blocks.

## 3. Structure

A reader parses the whole file as Markdown (§1) and reads the dictionary off the **top-level blocks** of the
resulting document. It does no line scanning of its own beyond R3.1.

- **R3.1 Header.**
  - Line 1 is an ATX level-1 heading, `# ` + title. The title is its text (R3.4) and is non-empty.
  - Line 2 is `wudict: <version>`, where the version is `MAJOR` or `MAJOR.MINOR` (ASCII digits). It is the
    version of this specification, not a flag.
  - If either condition fails → **E-format**. If MAJOR is unsupported → **E-version**. A reader accepts every
    MINOR of a MAJOR it supports; a MINOR adds only header keys.
  - A line 2 that is a near miss (`Wudict:1`, `wudict :1`) is E-version with the message "line 2 must be
    `wudict: 1`".
- **R3.2 Header fields.**
  - Line 2 starts the header paragraph. Each of its lines is `key: value`, where the key is `[a-z][a-z0-9-]*`,
    followed by `:`, one or more WS, and the value, trimmed and taken literally.
  - `from` and `to` are the BCP 47 tags of the headwords and of the article text.
  - Any other key is a header field, kept in order and shown as plain text.
  - The paragraph ends at the first blank line. A line in it that is not `key: value` ends the header, and it
    and the rest of the paragraph are ignored → W-entry.
- **R3.3 Description.** The top-level blocks after the header paragraph and before the first entry form the
  description, an ordinary body (§4).
- **R3.4 Heading text.** The text of a heading is the text content of its parsed inline content: escapes
  resolved, entities decoded, code spans kept as their content, emphasis, link and raw-HTML markup dropped with
  their text kept. The result is trimmed. Headwords are compared as exact code-point sequences; readers do not
  case-fold or normalize.
- **R3.5 Entries.** Every **top-level level-2 heading** (ATX or setext) starts an entry.
  - **Heading group.** Headings with no block between them form one entry. Link reference definitions do not
    count as blocks; an HTML comment does. The first heading is the **headword** and the others are its
    **aliases**, in order. Headings with empty text are skipped, and repeats within a group are dropped.
  - **Body.** The top-level blocks after the group, up to the next level-2 heading or the end of the file.
  - A heading inside a list, a blockquote, an HTML block or a code block is content, as Markdown defines it.
  - Repeated headwords across groups are separate entries (homographs).
- **R3.6 Redirect.** An entry whose body is exactly one paragraph of exactly one line `see: <target>` is a
  redirect. The target is the literal text after `see:` and WS, trimmed.
  - Every name of the entry leads to the entries whose headword or alias equals the target.
  - Readers resolve nothing beyond that one step, and match the target exactly or, failing that, ignoring case.
  - If no entry matches, the redirect is shown as a lookup link to the target (§5). A reader MAY yield it as an
    article whose body is that link, under every name of the entry.
- **R3.7 Empty entry.** A heading group followed by no body (end of file) is not an entry → W-entry.

## 4. Bodies

- **R4.1** A body is Markdown (§1). Readers render it with the stock renderer of their Markdown library:
  - raw HTML passed through;
  - no typographer, no linkify, no automatic heading ids;
  - no sanitizing (R9.1).

  Link reference definitions apply file-wide, as in CommonMark.
- **R4.2** Anything Markdown cannot express stays **raw HTML**. That is standard Markdown: inline tags
  (`bank<sup>1</sup>`) and HTML blocks, including a whole body as one HTML block (R6.4).
- **R4.3** `<details>` holding Markdown is written as an HTML block, a blank line, the Markdown, a blank line and
  `</details>`:

  ```
  <details>
  <summary>More examples</summary>

  - *run a risk*
  - *run late*

  </details>
  ```
- **R4.4** Admonitions (`!!! note "Title"`, zensical/Material style) have **no meaning in version 1**. They render
  as stock Markdown renders them: `!!! note` as text, and an indented body as a code block. A later MINOR may
  give them meaning.
- **R4.5** Strikethrough is inline HTML: `<del>x</del>`. `~~x~~` has no meaning in version 1. It is a GFM extension
  that some viewers enable, so writers escape `~` in text so that such viewers show the same text.

## 5. Links and resources

- **R5.1** A **lookup link** is `entry://` + target, optionally followed by `#` + fragment.
  - In the target, `%`, `#`, control characters and a leading `@` are percent-encoded (`%25`, `%23`, `%XX`,
    `%40`), and nothing else.
  - As a Markdown destination it is written in angle brackets when it contains a space:
    `[long run](<entry://long run>)`.
- **R5.2** Reading a lookup link:
  1. Take the text after the scheme (`entry:` or `bword:`, with or without `//`, case-insensitive; also `d:`,
     `x:`).
  2. Split at the first literal `#`.
  3. Percent-decode each half. The decode is all or nothing: if a half does not decode to valid UTF-8, it is
     kept as written.
  4. Trim the target.

  An empty target is an anchor in the current article. A target whose **undecoded** form starts with `@` and is
  longer than one character is an MDict sub-entry, which a host may inline. Writers emit only `entry://`.
- **R5.3** Stock renderers percent-encode destinations. That is allowed, because R5.2 decodes. A renderer MUST NOT
  decode or double-encode an existing `%HH`.
- **R5.4** A **resource reference** is a relative `src`, or a relative `href` whose last segment, `#…` and `?…`
  cut, ends in a file extension a dictionary bundles, ignoring case: `.css .js .html .htm .png .jpg .jpeg .gif
  .webp .svg .bmp .ico .avif .mp3 .ogg .oga .wav .spx .m4a .opus .flac .aac .mp4 .webm .ogv .mov .m4v .3gp .avi
  .wmv .mkv .mpg .mpeg .asf .flv .pcx .dcx .wmf .emf .tif .tiff .pdf .woff .woff2 .ttf .otf .eot .json .xml
  .txt`. It resolves in the container (R2.3). A leading `./` or `/` is ignored, `#…` and `?…` are cut, and the
  rest is percent-decoded. Any other relative `href` - not only a `#…` or `?…` - names a headword, and is read
  as a lookup link (R5.2).

## 6. Writer

- **R6.1 Layout.**

  ```
  # <name>
  wudict: 1
  from: <tag>                     (when known)
  to: <tag>                       (when known)
  <key>: <value>                  (each header field, source order)

  <description>                   (when non-empty)

  ## <headword>
  ## <alias>                      (each, source order, then folded redirects)

  <body>

  ## <name>                       (a redirect that reaches no article, R6.4)
  see: <target>
  ```

  Sections are separated by one blank line. The headings of a group are on consecutive lines, and a `see:` line
  follows its group directly.
- **R6.2 Names** (title, headwords, aliases, targets, header values):
  - invalid UTF-8 and NUL → U+FFFD, in names and in bodies alike: a writer never emits what a reader would have to
    repair (R2.1);
  - CR, LF and TAB → SP; other C0 and DEL removed; trimmed;
  - an empty headword is replaced by the first non-empty alias; an entry with no name is dropped;
  - repeats in a group are dropped.

  In headings, the writer backslash-escapes `` \ ` * _ [ ] < > & ~ ``, and escapes the first `#` of a trailing run
  of `#` that follows WS (`## C \#`).
- **R6.3 Header keys.**
  - A source key is lowercased, each run of characters outside `[a-z0-9]` becomes `-`, and leading and trailing
    `-` are trimmed.
  - A key starting with a digit, or equal to `wudict`, `from`, `to` or `meta`, gets the prefix `x-`.
  - A key that ends up empty is written `meta: <original key>: <value>`.
  - A multi-line value is joined with SP.
- **R6.4 Redirects are folded.**
  - A source redirect to a target that is a headword or alias of an article becomes an alias of **every** such
    article, after the article's own names. Chains are followed to an article, stopping at a repeat.
  - A redirect whose target matches no article is written as its own entry with the body `see: <target>`.
  - An article with an empty body is dropped, and the writer counts it.
- **R6.5 Modes.** The writer has two modes, chosen for the whole file, never per article.
  - **`clean`:** every body goes through the allowlist of R6.6, then the conversion of R6.7. Cleanup is
    destructive and best effort: anything outside the allowlist is dropped or unwrapped, never kept.
  - **`html`** (default, since it loses nothing): every body is written **verbatim** as one HTML block:
    - The body is wrapped in `<div>` + LF … LF + `</div>` **unless** it is already a single element whose tag
      starts a CommonMark type-6 HTML block (`div`, `section`, `table`, …) with nothing around it but WS.
    - The block must hold **no blank line**:
      - inside `pre`, `textarea` and `listing`, a blank line is written as `&#10;` at the start of the following
        line;
      - inside `script` and `style`, blank lines are removed;
      - elsewhere, they are removed.
    - Lookup links take their canonical spelling (`bword:` → `entry://`, `entry://@x` → `entry:@x`), because
      writers emit only `entry://` (R5.2).
    - Nothing else changes.
- **R6.6 The `clean` allowlist.**

  | Source | Written as |
  |---|---|
  | `p`; `div`, `section`, `article` and other block containers (unwrapped) | paragraph breaks |
  | `br` | `\` + LF inside a paragraph (`<br>` + LF right after a text `\`); dropped at its end; doubled ones merge |
  | `em`, `i` · `strong`, `b` | `*x*` · `**x**` when the content starts and ends with a letter, digit or mark, holds no unescaped `*` and does not follow a `*`; otherwise inline `<em>` or `<strong>` |
  | `sup`, `sub`, `u`, `small`, `del` (`s` and `strike` become `del`) | the same tag as inline HTML, without attributes |
  | `code` · `pre` > `code` | code span (inline `<code>` right after a backtick) · fenced code block (info from `language-X`) |
  | `a[href]` | `[text](dest "title")`, `dest` in the canonical form of R6.9; an `a` without `href` is unwrapped |
  | `img[src]` | `![alt](src "title")` |
  | `audio`, `video`, `source`, pronunciation `object` | `[▶](file)` |
  | `ul`, `ol[start]`, `li` | `-` / `1.` lists, R6.10 |
  | `blockquote` | `> ` lines |
  | `h1`–`h6` | `###`–`######`; `h1` and `h2` are **demoted** to `###` |
  | `hr` | `***` |
  | `table` | GFM table: the first row is the header; cell `align` is kept; block content in a cell is flattened with `<br>` |
  | `details`, `summary` | R4.3 |
  | `script`, `style`, `template`, `iframe`, form controls, other `object` | removed with their content |
  | anything else | unwrapped: its content is kept; one that holds a block (by tag or by the stylesheet) is laid out as CSS lays out a block inside an inline box: the text before, the block and the text after are separate blocks |
  | every attribute not named above | removed |

  **The dictionary's stylesheet.** A dictionary's layout is often in its CSS, not in its tags: nested
  `<span class="…">` elements the stylesheet makes blocks, hides, or spaces apart. So `clean` reads the
  stylesheets its articles link (`<link rel="stylesheet">` to a resource of the dictionary) and reduces them to one
  table: for each class, whether it is a block, inline or hidden (`display`), and whether it is set apart (a
  positive `margin` or `padding` on its left or right). Only class selectors are read, by the rightmost compound;
  pseudo-classes, attribute and id selectors are ignored; a compound selector (`.a.b`) never hides. An element
  takes the strongest display of its classes (block, then inline, then hidden). Then:
  - an element the stylesheet hides is removed with its content;
  - an element that is inline by tag and a block by its classes is a paragraph break, keeping its own markup when
    it has some (`b`, `a[href]`, …); inside a heading, a cell or inline markup it is a hard break (a SP in a
    heading);
  - an inline element the stylesheet sets apart has a SP on either side.

  A dictionary without a stylesheet is converted by its tags alone.
- **R6.7 Conversion.**
  - Text whitespace runs become one SP; lines break only at hard breaks and block boundaries.
  - WS at the start or end of an element's content that is written as markup (emphasis, the inline tags, a link)
    is written outside it: `a<b> x </b>y` → `a **x** y`, `cart<a href="…"> at upset</a>` → `cart [at upset](…)`.
  - Text backslash-escapes `` \ ` * _ [ ] < > & ~ | ``, and a `!` right before a link's `[`.
  - At the start of a line - of a paragraph, or after a hard break - text also escapes `#`, `+`, `-`, `=` and `:`
    (`:` and `-` could start a table delimiter row), and the delimiter of a 1-9 digit run followed by `.` or `)`
    and then a space, a tab or the end of the line (an ordered list marker). This is decided on the finished line,
    whatever node its text came from.
  - A body whose only block would be the one line `see: …` has its `:` escaped (`see\: …`).
  - Code spans use the shortest backtick run not in the content. Fences are max(3, longest run + 1) backticks.
  - Inside a table cell, a `|` in a destination is written `%7C`, and in a title or alt text `\|`.
- **R6.8 Failure.** If a `clean` body still cannot be written after R6.6, the writer **aborts**:
  - it leaves no partial output (writes to a temporary file and renames on success);
  - it writes the whole raw entry (names and source HTML) to **stdout**;
  - it writes to **stderr**:

  ```
  error: entry "run" (#1234): <construct> cannot be written as clean markdown: <reason>
  hint: keep the dictionary's HTML instead:
    wudict dump -format md -mode html -o <outdir> <dictfile>
  ```

  Before a body is accepted, the writer parses it as a reader will; a top-level level-1 or level-2 heading in it
  would split the entry, and is such a failure.
- **R6.9 Destinations.** A stock renderer percent-encodes destinations (R5.3), so a destination is written in a
  canonical form that reads the same after a round trip, and stays readable:
  - a lookup link: `entry://` + the target percent-decoded (R5.2) and encoded again by R5.1, so
    `[вода](entry://вода)`, not `entry://%D0%B2…`; a sub-entry keeps its raw `@` (`entry:@sub`); `bword:`, `d:`
    and `x:` become `entry:`;
  - a link's relative `href` that names a headword (R5.4): written as the lookup link, `entry://` + the target,
    and `#` + the fragment when there is one (`<a href="cooking apple#s2">` → `[…](<entry://cooking apple#s2>)`);
  - any other relative path (a resource): percent-decoded, with only `%`, `#`, `?` and control characters
    encoded; a `?…` or `#…` suffix is kept;
  - any other URL: every character the renderer would encode already encoded, so the renderer changes nothing;
  - in markdown, in angle brackets when it holds a space or a control character, and with `&` written `\&`.
- **R6.10 Lists.**
  - Markers are `-` and `N.`, numbered from `start`. A list right after a list of the same kind and marker
    switches to `*` or `N)`, so the two stay two.
  - An empty item is left out: a bare marker is where parsers disagree.
  - A list is tight when each item is one block, or a paragraph followed by sub-lists that can interrupt it (a
    first item that is not empty and, if ordered, starts at 1). Otherwise it is loose: its items and their blocks
    are separated by blank lines.
  - Continuation lines are indented by the marker's width plus one.
  - Lists and quotes nest at most 16 deep; deeper levels join their parent's flow.

## 7. Guarantees

- **R7.1** `html` mode keeps every article's HTML, except for the wrapper `<div>`, the blank lines removed outside
  `pre`, `textarea` and `listing`, and lookup links respelled to `entry://` (R6.5).
- **R7.2** `clean` mode is lossy by design. It keeps text, the allowlisted structure, links and media.
- **R7.3** For a file F that a writer produced in mode M, exporting the import of F in mode M SHOULD give F back.
  Conformance tests check this; it is not a proof obligation of the writer.
- **R7.4** The writer is deterministic: the same input gives the same bytes.

## 8. Diagnostics

| Code | Condition | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| E-format | line 1 is not `# title`, or line 2 is not the `wudict` field | not read |
| E-version | unsupported MAJOR, or a malformed or near-miss line 2 | not read |
| W-entry | a heading group without a body, a malformed header line | skipped, reading continues |

The writer reports counts: dropped empty entries, names repaired by R6.2. A `clean` failure is the only writer
error (R6.8).

## 9. Security

- **R9.1** Files are untrusted. Raw HTML, event attributes and `javascript:` links pass through the reader, so
  hosts MUST sanitize or isolate article HTML before display.
- **R9.2** Decompression is bounded, and resource resolution never leaves the container (R2.3).

## 10. Examples

The same entries in both modes.

**Source articles (HTML):**
- `run`, aliases `runs`: `<span class="pos">v.</span> <b>1</b> to move quickly on foot <a href="bword://walk">walk</a>`;
- `ran` → redirect to `run`;
- `C#`: `<p>A language.</p><h2>History</h2><p>2000.</p>`.

**`clean`:**

```
# Sample
wudict: 1

## run
## runs
## ran

v. **1** to move quickly on foot [walk](entry://walk)

## C#

A language.

### History

2000\.
```

**`html`:**

```
# Sample
wudict: 1

## run
## runs
## ran

<div>
<span class="pos">v.</span> <b>1</b> to move quickly on foot <a href="entry://walk">walk</a>
</div>

## C#

<div>
<p>A language.</p><h2>History</h2><p>2000.</p>
</div>
```

In both modes the source's `bword://walk` is written `entry://walk`. That respelling is the only change `html`
mode makes inside a body.

**Import of either:** three entries with these names:
- `run` / `runs` / `ran`;
- `C#`.

The `C#` body is `<p>A language.</p><h3>History</h3><p>2000.</p>` (clean; `2000\.` escapes what would otherwise be
an ordered list starting at 2000, R6.7) or the `<div>` block (html).

## Appendix A. Implementer notes (informative)

**Go.**
- goldmark with `extension.Table` and `html.WithUnsafe()`. There is no custom parser or renderer.
- Walk `doc.FirstChild()` siblings for R3.
- Render an entry by rendering its node range with the stock renderer.
- Verify the R5.3 behaviour of goldmark's destination escaping on `%HH` before relying on it.

**Python.**
- `MarkdownIt("commonmark", {"html": True}).enable("table")`.
- Walk the token stream's top-level `heading_open` tokens (`h2`, `level == 0`).
- `md.normalizeLink` percent-encodes non-ASCII, which R5.3 permits.

**pyglossary.**

| wudict | pyglossary |
|---|---|
| heading group | `newEntry([headword, *aliases], body, defiFormat="h")` |
| title, `from`, `to`, header fields, description | the `name`, `sourceLang`, `targetLang`, other and `description` info keys |
| resources | `newDataEntry` |

On write, pyglossary has no redirects: its terms list is already the folded form of R6.4.
