# Handoff archive — per-session narrative

The history of agent sessions on this Android fork, moved out of `HANDOFF.md` on
2026-09-26 so the live file can be read whole. **Nothing here is current state**:
the current state is `HANDOFF.md`, and the build/test recipes are
`docs/WINDOWS-VERIFY.md`.

Read it by grep (`grep -n "<word>" docs/handoff-archive.md`), not end to end, and
prefer the newest section on a subject — the same feature was revisited across
sessions, each time correcting what came before. The index lists every section
with its date and the line numbers it had in the pre-split file, which is still
reachable as `git show 51c0737:HANDOFF.md`. The commit messages carry the same
narratives, so `git log` is a second copy.

## The preset-switch "crash" was a TDZ cascade (2026-09-25, diagnosis only)

The user reported the app dying after switching presets and asked for the log.
Diagnosis taken on the emulator, against `com.dmshepeta.wudict2.debug` built
11:36 from `gaffe374` — a commit this checkout no longer has (the tree has since
moved through `dev2`/`Night-Day`). **No code was changed for this**; what follows
is the finding plus two guards that were proposed and not yet built.

- **What the log holds** (`adb logcat`, `chromium: [INFO:CONSOLE:…]`): exactly
  five errors, all inside 90 ms at 13:36:41, all the same kind —
  `Cannot access 'X' before initialization` — for `appearanceState` (page line
  5166), `sheetMenus` (5003), `cfgInfo` (2063, as an unhandled rejection),
  `PRESETS` (4660, inside `presetsLoad`'s catch) and `stylerSubject` (4816).
- **What that means**: every one of those names is declared AFTER page line
  2023 in the page's single big inline script, so the script's top-level flow
  had **stopped before line 2023**: everything below stayed in the temporal
  dead zone, and whoever ran next — `group-editor.js`'s boot chain, `looks.js`,
  or the shell's injected `appearanceRead()`/`DICTIONARY_PICKER_JS` — hit those
  bindings and threw. The page is left half-initialised. No app crash, no server
  crash: the process stays up and the UI is dead, which is what "программа
  упала" looks like from the outside.
- **The root event is NOT in the log** — no SyntaxError, no exception before
  that burst. A classic script that throws gets its throw logged, so the
  execution was cut from OUTSIDE: a navigation or a stopped load landing while
  the script was still running.
- **It does not reproduce.** The APK's own page text was pulled out of the
  running app and loaded in desktop Chromium with a `window.onerror` hook —
  zero errors. The app on the emulator, driven over CDP
  (`adb forward tcp:9222 localabstract:webview_devtools_remote_<pid>` plus a
  WebSocket client over `node:net`, since the REPL has no WebSocket global), has
  `cfgInfo`/`PRESETS`/`appearanceState` initialised, its Looks row working, and
  `POST /api/looks/apply` answering 200 for `clean` and `oldpaper`; a fresh
  launch logs no page errors at all.
- **Where a navigation can cut a load short** (the race to close): the shell has
  three paths that may start one while the page is still running —
  `MainActivity.reloadPage()` (669) called by `Intake` on an import/library
  change (408, 477); `onNewIntent`'s `EXTRA_RELOAD` reload (685, the "Clear
  browser cache" flow); and a forwarded query's `loadUrl(searchUrl)` (695,
  handed over by `LookupActivity`), which has two more of its own (391, 440).
- **Proposed guards, neither a rewrite**: (a) shell-side — do not start a second
  navigation while one is in flight (hold `reloadPage()`/the reload intent until
  `onPageFinished`, or queue it); (b) page-side — give the boot chain one
  recovery: wrap it in `group-editor.js`'s boot and on failure reload the page
  once behind a `sessionStorage` flag, so a cut script costs a blink instead of
  the whole UI. Cheap third: stop substituting `{{USERCSS}}` inside the JS
  comment at `index.html:1047` — harmless today, a tripwire the day a
  substitution carries `*/`.
- **Separate, unrelated**: the emulator runs the arm64 Go binary through
  `ndk_translation`, and the dropbox holds a native crash of `libwudict.so
  serve …` from 2026-09-24 17:10. That failure mode (the SERVER dying, which the
  app surfaces as "server failed") is possible on this emulator and is not what
  happened here.

## The picker's jump is instant now, always (2026-09-25, this session)

The user's instruction after asking what the system lever was: instant ONLY
when a dictionary is picked off the picker's list — the other two scrolls keep
the system's answer. So `window.wudictPickerDictionarySelected` (one call site)
now scrolls with a bare `behavior:"auto"`, and the comment above it says why:
the destination was chosen by the reader, the jump can cross a document tens of
thousands of pixels tall, and this is the same call `navGo` already makes for a
match more than two screens away. Untouched and still conditional on
`prefers-reduced-motion`: the section opened by hand (the summary click) and
`revealAt` (the walk through matches), because there the path is part of the
reading. No CSS interferes — `scroll-behavior` is `auto` everywhere in this
app, which is what makes `"auto"` mean "no animation".

**What made the user say it did not work, measured on the emulator:** on Android
`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` IS "animator duration scale == 0", and **the
WebView reads that value ONCE, when the app's browser process starts**. With
`animator_duration_scale = 0`, the page still reported `reduce: false` live and
still false after a `Page.reload`; after `am force-stop` + start it reported
`true`, and the jump measured instant (scrollY 0 → 733, unchanged at 80 ms and
at 780 ms). So the lever needs an app RESTART, not a page reload — and on the
emulator the setting was unset (`null`, i.e. default 1.0) the whole time, which
is the plain reason nothing felt instant. Both of those are now moot for the
picker, which no longer asks.

**Verified as an A/B on the device's own WebView** (adb reverse of this
machine's test server + CDP on the app's WebView; `prefers-reduced-motion` false
in BOTH runs): the APK's page (old code) animated — scrollY 9 at 80 ms, 277 at
300 ms, 456 at 900 ms; the current tree's page (new code) was already at 456 at
80 ms and did not move after. Also `go build ./...` and `git diff --check`
clean. The app was left on its own page and the emulator's settings untouched
(`animator_duration_scale` back to unset).

## Emulator builds: `build-android.cmd debug intel` (2026-09-24, this session)

The user's Android Studio AVD is x86_64 (`sdk_gphone16k_x86_64`, Android
17/API 37, 16 KiB pages), where the app's Java half starts and the exec'd Go
server never does. The diagnosis is in the verification-recipes section below;
what this session CHANGED is the build path that follows from it. Uncommitted
on `dev` on top of `3178bc1`.

- **`build-android.cmd [debug|release] [intel]`** — the token is accepted in
  either position, a bare `intel` means a debug build, and `release intel` plus
  any unknown token are refused before anything is built. `%~2` is no longer
  "retired"; `-PemuX86=1` is what the script hands Gradle.
- **The trap worth remembering**: `androidComponents.onVariants` runs for EVERY
  variant, `fossRelease` included, even when only `assembleFossDebug` was asked
  for. An earlier version of this change THREW from there on a non-debug
  variant and failed the debug build outright. The abi token is therefore
  decided per VARIANT (`emuX86 && variant.buildType == 'debug'`) and nothing
  throws there — a release built with the flag is simply arm64, and its name
  says arm64.
- **Verified** (2026-09-24, Windows cmd): `debug intel` puts both ABIs in
  `wudict2-android-arm64-x86_64-foss-debug.apk`; the x86_64 lib taken back OUT
  of that APK runs on the emulator and prints `wudict2-v0.1.0-43-g3178bc1-dirty`;
  plain `debug` and plain `release` stay arm64-only with the x86_64 lib sitting
  on disk the whole time; `release intel` and `debug arm` are refused.
- **AGP deletes the other APK from the variant's output dir**: building plain
  `debug` after `debug intel` removes the emulator APK (different output file
  name, same directory). Normal hygiene, but the two cannot sit side by side.
- **Owed**: the APK was never installed, so no device has run the app on the
  emulator. `adb install -r android/app/build/outputs/apk/foss/debug/wudict2-android-arm64-x86_64-foss-debug.apk`.
- **No Makefile target was added** — `make` is not installed on this machine, so
  it could not have been verified. `android-go-x86_64` plus an emulator APK
  target is the obvious follow-up for the Unix side.

## Branch `Night-Day`: a look per theme (2026-09-25, this session)

The user's request: switching day/night should switch the appearance with it -
the window background, the BACKGROUND presets, and the user's App/Article CSS.
A branch off `dev` (`e1304c9`); `dev` is untouched and nothing is committed.

**"Per theme" means the RESOLVED theme** (`themeIsDark()`, `data-dark`), not the
stored mode - so "auto" following the system at sunset moves everything too.
`syncAutoDark()` is the one place that knows it, and it drives the whole switch.

- **The user CSS is four files now.** Day keeps `app.css`/`article.css`; night
  gets `app_night.css`/`article_night.css`. `styleNamesFor(theme)` is the whole
  mapping, and empty is a state rather than a gap: an empty night file emits no
  `<link>` at all, so "no user CSS at night" IS the app's own dark theme.
  Existing installs need no migration - their `app.css` is already the day file.
- **Both pairs are linked and one is disabled** (`data-skin="light|dark"`),
  rather than the server picking: the theme is a fact of the browser, not of the
  request. Linking both keeps each file's own content-addressed URL, so editing
  the day sheet does not invalidate the night one, and the sheet the reader is
  about to need is already in memory.
- **The editor edits the theme it is in.** `stylerText`/`stylerSaved` stay "the
  pair being edited", so their twenty-odd readers are untouched; `stylerOther`
  holds the other theme's text AND its disk copy, so a switch mid-edit swaps
  instead of discarding. `PUT /api/style` gained `theme`.
- **The presets needed no storing at all.** All four BACKGROUND presets were
  ALREADY theme-scoped in their own CSS (`Sepia` is `html:not([data-dark])`,
  `True black`/`Warm dark` are `html[data-dark]`); what stopped "Sepia by day,
  True black by night" was the radio rule switching every group-mate off. It now
  switches off only group-mates IN THE SAME THEME (`preset.Theme`, a new
  manifest field), so both are simply on and each applies in its own theme.
- **The window background is per theme in the SHELL**, chosen by
  `ShellPrefs.pageDark` - the resolved theme it already tracks. That is what
  lets the window be painted correctly BEFORE the page exists rather than
  corrected a frame later. Every reader is theme-aware (`sepia`, `sepiaColor`,
  `sepiaColorText`, `backgroundImage`), so the dozen call sites elsewhere in the
  Java are untouched. The bridge carries `night` explicitly: inferring it from
  `pageDark` would race, because the watcher's report comes by a slower road.
- **A real bug found on the way, and it is the one reported from the start.**
  `takeThemeReport` set `pageDark` and repainted the WebView but never re-told
  the PAGE, so `data-shell-image`/`data-shell-sepia` kept the old theme's values
  - a dark app whose history window still wore the day wallpaper. It now calls
  `Shell.applyBackground(web)`, which is what pushes the new theme to the page.
- **Verified on the emulator**, all of it: the skin links read
  `light:ON,dark:off` and the reverse; a marker written into each file comes
  back as the applied sheet (`rgb(1,2,3)` at light, `rgb(4,5,6)` at dark); the
  window background reads `#112233` at light and `#445566` at dark; `sepia`
  (light) and `true_black` (dark) are enabled TOGETHER; and on a LIVE switch -
  no reload, the path that was broken - `data-shell-image` goes false and the
  history window goes `rgb(10,10,10)`.
- **Tests**: `go build`, `go vet`, the Go suite and the Java compile are clean.
  The server suite leaves `TestOpenAPICoversEveryRoute` and `TestSetupFlow`,
  both re-checked on a clean `dev` worktree and failing there identically.
- **`paper_03.jpg` joined the built-in wallpapers** as the night one. The list
  is duplicated - `WindowBackground.directory`'s array decides whether the file
  is unpacked at all, `BUILTIN_BACKGROUNDS` in the page decides what the manager
  says about it - and both now name it; the page's comment says so, because the
  two must agree and nothing enforces it. Verified on the emulator: the shell
  copied it into `.wudict/style/assets/` at startup and `appearanceRequest`'s
  `images` offers all three.
- **A second raw-key read, found from the phone and fixed.** `applyBackground`
  asked the THEME-AWARE `WindowBackground.active(c)` whether there was an image
  but read the image's NAME from the un-suffixed key, so at night it sent a
  true image flag with the DAY wallpaper's name. The page then layered paper_01
  over the night colour - which is what the reader saw and reported as "the
  Appearance sheet kept the day's picture". It now reads through
  `ShellPrefs.backgroundImage(c)`, and `grep '"background_image"'` across the
  Java finds only the constant's own declaration.
- **`background_image_article.css` lost every `:not([data-dark])`** (the user's
  call): the article's paper treatment now applies in BOTH themes, which is what
  the day/night pair made necessary - a rule restricted to the light theme left
  a reader whose night background IS a paper looking at articles with no paper
  behind them. Nothing names a theme now; every value comes from `--paper-bg`
  and `--paper-bk-image`, which the host sets from the current theme, so an
  article wears whichever paper is in force and a reader with no night paper
  gets the app's own dark surface. The comments that said "LIGHT MODE ONLY"
  were rewritten with it - a comment that describes a restriction that is gone
  is worse than none. Verified: the served preset CSS has zero `data-dark`
  occurrences and the page's `presetArticleCSS` carries the paper rules.
- **`background_image_app.css` was wrong in two ways, both fixed** (the user's
  call): it keyed on `:is([data-shell-sepia], [data-shell-image])` although the
  preset is the IMAGE one (`requiresImage` in the manifest says so - a colour
  with no wallpaper is the Sepia preset's case), and it carried the same
  `:not([data-theme="dark"])` as the article half. The sepia hook is gone
  entirely; the theme guard is gone everywhere EXCEPT the palette block, and
  that exception is load-bearing rather than leftover: that block sets WARM, DARK
  text (`--fg:#3b3229`), which is what reads on a light paper and is exactly what
  must not be put on a dark one. So it was split - the two SURFACE variables
  (`--bg-card`, `--wd-article-bg`) apply in both themes, the palette does not -
  and it is now the only theme condition left in the file, with a comment saying
  why. Measured with the preset on: light gives `--fg:#3b3229`,
  `--bg-card:transparent`, `.bar` `rgb(237,209,166)`; dark gives `--fg:#d8d5d0`
  (the app's own dark palette, untouched), `--bg-card:transparent`, `.bar`
  `rgb(51,33,17)` - the night paper.
- **The night theme was getting the light paper's colours - the reader's second
  report, and the reason the Settings panel was unreadable on a near-black
  paper.** `background_image_app.css` was 37 lines of LITERAL warm values -
  cream washes, `rgba(120,90,45,…)` borders, `color:#79654b !important` on
  `.meta` and friends - against only 7 rules whose values come from the host. So
  the file is now split by what each rule is ABOUT: the 7 that paint the paper
  itself (`--bg-card`, `--wd-article-bg`, `body`, the bar/panel/card paper
  colour, a disabled card's opacity) carry no theme condition, and the other 26
  - the palette and every warm wash - are light-only, with a comment saying why.
  The article half got the same treatment for its two multiply rules: multiply
  is what makes a white JPEG background read as the paper, and against a
  near-black one it would crush the picture into it instead. Measured with the
  preset on: light gives `--fg:#3b3229`, `--fg-soft:#5d4d3a`, `.meta`
  `rgb(121,101,75)`; dark gives `--fg:#d8d5d0`, `--fg-soft:#96938d`, `.meta`
  `rgb(95,92,87)` - the app's own, untouched - with `--bg-card` transparent and
  the bar and cards on the NIGHT paper in both themes.
- **Why not the two night files that were asked for**:
  `background_image_app_night.css` would contain exactly the 7 rules the guard
  leaves unguarded - the same behaviour - but it needs a per-theme half in the
  manifest, in `presets.go`, in `presetLinksHTML` and in `presetApplyAll`, plus
  the server's first-paint links carrying `data-skin` like the user CSS pair
  does. Worth it if a preset ever needs a DIFFERENT dark look rather than no
  dark look; not needed to keep the browns off a dark paper.
- **A paper lifts the muted registers under a dark theme.** The dark palette's
  `--fg-soft`/`--fg-faint` are tuned for the app's own near-black surface, and
  on a paper of ANY kind - a colour or a texture - they landed within a shade of
  it: the sheet's seg labels and the hints under the Screen dropdowns came out
  unreadable, reported from the phone both with an image and without one. So
  the rule lives in app.css, not in a preset: a preset would only cover the
  paper it belongs to, and the complaint covered both. Keyed on
  `html:is([data-shell-sepia],[data-shell-image])[data-dark]` it sets
  `--fg-soft:#ded8cc`, `--fg-faint:#c6beaf`, `--line`/`--line-soft` - the values
  lemmas.html and browse.html already use for their dark tone, so a paper reads
  the same wherever the reader meets one. `--fg`, `--link` and `--accent` are
  left alone. Measured: dark+paper gives `--fg-faint:#c6beaf` and the seg label
  `rgb(198,190,175)`; light+paper keeps the app's own `#a5a19a`.
- **The empty App and Article boxes now list their variables.** `stylerShowTab`
  already set a two-line placeholder per tab; `STYLE_HINT` keeps those opening
  sentences and adds the token list behind them - `--bg`/`--bg-card`/`--bg-bar`,
  `--fg`/`--fg-soft`/`--fg-faint`, `--accent`, `--line`, `--link`, `--focus`,
  `--paper-bg`/`--paper-bk-image`, `--wd-article-*` - plus what
  `html[data-dark]` and `html[data-theme="dark"]` mean, and that the box edits
  the LIGHT theme's file. A placeholder and not seeded text: it never reaches
  the file, never shows in a diff, and is gone on the first keystroke. Both
  lists were checked against app.css's `:root`; `--paper-bg` and
  `--paper-bk-image` are not defined there because the HOST sets them at run
  time, which is also why they are worth documenting.
- **The panel's Appearance section is four doors now** (the user's proposal,
  after two rounds of it): `Edges of the screen…`, `Window background…`,
  `Visual presets…`, `Custom CSS…`, each opening the SAME non-modal sheet on
  ITS OWN group. The old single row ("Screen, background, CSS…") opened all of
  it at once, so a reader who wanted two rows about the screen got the whole
  appearance surface - and could not see from the panel that the screen was in
  there at all.
- **Why rows and not the controls themselves, and why not dialogs**: each of
  these is a LIVE PREVIEW - a wallpaper, a preset or an edge is judged by
  watching the page change - and the sheet says `aria-modal="false"` for
  exactly that reason. A dialog paints the paper over the very thing being
  adjusted (`.group-dialog::backdrop` is the reader's own paper); the app's
  colour window escapes that only because it carries a swatch of its own, which
  a preset has no equivalent of. `stylerOpen(subject)` sets the groups by
  subject; the bars stay, because they are how the reader moves between
  subjects once inside AND because `appearanceGroupSet` is what makes the sheet
  measure itself. A click straight on the function still opens on the presets,
  where this sheet has always started.
- **Verified on the emulator**: `screen` → only that group, sheet 375px; `bg` →
  only that, 299px; `presets` → the css group on the Presets tab, 437px; `css` →
  the same on App/Article. Each door now gets the sheet's own height, where
  before every door gave the full one. The old `#stylerLink` id is gone.
- **The sheet's head names its subject.** The panel's four doors say "Window
  background…" and the sheet answered "Appearance" - a different word for the
  thing just asked for, so the reader had to check they had got what they came
  for. `stylerOpen(subject)` sets `#stylerTitle` from `STYLER_SUBJECTS`, one
  map whose words are the doors' own, so the two cannot drift. Verified on the
  emulator: all four subjects set their own title.
- **The sheet was rebuilt: one subject at a time, chosen in its head.** The
  panel's four doors already opened a subject each; what changed is that the
  sheet now SHOWS one - the bars and the whole fold machinery are gone, and the
  head carries a menu of the four (`#stylerSubject` + `#stylerSubjectMenu`,
  drawn with the same `screenChoice` the two Screen answers use).
  - `stylerSubjectSet(name)` is the whole state: it hides the other three panes,
    ticks the menu, and measures the sheet. `appearanceOpen`, `appearanceBars`,
    `appearanceBodies`, `appearanceGroupSet`, the bar handlers and the automatic
    collapse of the Window-background group while the caret is in the CSS box
    are all deleted.
  - **Presets is a subject of its own**, not the CSS group's fourth tab: it is
    not CSS, and reaching it meant opening Custom CSS. `stylerView` lost its
    `presets` value; Custom CSS keeps App, Article and Files.
  - **The sheet is its own height at all times** (`height:auto` with
    `max-height:--styler-h` in app.css). The old `no-css` class said that for
    one case; with a single subject on screen it is the only case.
  - **A broken comment cost two builds and is worth remembering**: replacing the
    first lines of a multi-line HTML comment left its TAIL un-commented, so the
    prose rendered as page content - and it did not look like a markup error, it
    looked like the sheet printing paragraphs into every subject. When editing a
    comment by anchor, replace the whole comment.
  - Verified on the emulator after the fix: the page's script runs, the panel's
    four doors list as `screen/bg/presets/css`, the head's menu lists all four
    names, and the Presets subject renders its groups and switches.
- **The two Screen answers are radio groups now** (the user's call): five
  options for the edges, four for the bars, every one of them on screen at once.
  The menus they replace answered a problem that has since gone - a `<select>`
  would open the platform's popup, which can wear neither the app's colour nor
  its wallpaper - and a menu also HID the alternatives, which is the wrong trade
  for a set this small (Material's own ceiling for radios is five, and the edges
  row sits exactly there).
  - `radioGroup(box, options, onPick)` has the SAME `{set(i)}` contract as
    `screenChoice`, so `appearanceRender`'s two calls did not change. Native
    inputs styled with `appearance:none` the way the group editor's checkbox
    already is, so the keyboard, the arrow keys and the screen reader come with
    them; the ROW is the target and not the 20px circle.
  - **The option arrays are read in order and the INDEX is the stored mode** -
    see the note above `SCREEN_EDGE_OPTIONS` - so neither may be rearranged.
  - Verified on the emulator: 5 and 4 inputs render, the checked one is the
    stored mode (3, "A colour you pick", at the time), and the colour field
    appears only for that mode.
  - `screenChoice` survives for the sheet's subject menu in the head, where
    hiding the alternatives is right: there the list IS the thing.
- **The margin colour rides on its own option's row** (the user's call). It used
  to be a separate row labelled "Colour" under the group, shown only while "A
  colour you pick" was the mode - which said the same thing twice (the option
  already names it) and put the value one row away from the option that gives it
  meaning. `#edgeColorRow` is gone; `#edgeColorBox` is moved onto that radio's
  row once, at load, by an IIFE beside the group's construction, and it STILL
  hides itself while another option is chosen - "a field for a value nothing is
  using is a question the reader has to answer before it means anything" is the
  app's own rule and it still holds. `.radio-row` wraps, so a narrow phone puts
  the field under the label instead of squeezing the row.
  Verified on the emulator: the box is a descendant of the 4th radio row (mode
  3, EDGE_CUSTOM) and visible while that mode is the stored one.
  Hiding has a trap that cost a round: a `display:none` element measures 0, so
  the field looked collapsed to BOTH the reader and my first measurement. The
  real cause was the width rule - `width:7.5em` lived on
  `.appearance-row input[type=text]`, and the box had just LEFT that row, so the
  input had no width of its own and, as a flex item of `.radio-row`, shrank to
  nothing beside the pipette (an empty input's min-content width is zero). The
  rule now names both rows and the box carries `flex:none`. Measured with the
  box shown: input 98px, pipette 26px, row 44px.
- **The margin colour rides on its own option's row, DIMMED rather than hidden
  when another option is chosen** (the user's two calls, in that order). It used
  to be a separate row labelled "Colour" shown only while "A colour you pick"
  was the mode - which said the same thing twice and put the value a row away
  from the option that gives it meaning.
  - `#edgeColorRow` is gone; `#edgeColorBox` is moved onto that radio's row once,
    at load, by an IIFE beside the group's construction.
  - The field then STAYS VISIBLE and goes inert instead of disappearing: it is
    part of what the option IS, so a reader choosing between the five sees what
    each offers, and an option whose field comes and goes reads as one with
    nothing behind it. `appearanceRender` sets `disabled` on the input and the
    pipette plus `aria-disabled` on the box; the dim is opacity .45, the Clear
    button's own disabled register. (The app dims where it CAN - the font
    stepper - but there the value is clamped and always in effect; here there is
    nothing to clamp.)
- **Two traps paid for on the way, both worth remembering.**
  - The field's width came from `.appearance-row input[type=text]`, and the box
    had just LEFT that row: the input had no width of its own and, as a flex
    item of `.radio-row`, shrank to nothing beside the pipette - which is what
    the reader saw as "squeezed to a circle". The rule now names both rows, and
    the box carries `flex:none` so a long option label cannot squeeze it.
  - **A `display:none` element measures 0**, so the first measurement of that
    collapse "confirmed" it for the wrong reason. Show the element first, then
    measure - and note that the box is legitimately hidden when the stored mode
    is not "A colour you pick".
  - Verified: input 98px (7.5em at 13px - room for `FFFFFF`), pipette 26px, row
    44px, opacity .45 while inert.
- **A preset that cannot apply where the reader is is SHOWN AND DISABLED, with
  the reason on its row** (the user's call, three cases). `Background image` used
  to be skipped entirely when the shell had no wallpaper, and `Sepia` /
  `True black` / `Warm dark` were offered in BOTH themes although their own CSS
  is scoped to one - so a reader could switch on something that would never do
  anything. A missing row answers "why is this not here?" with silence, and the
  theme and the wallpaper are not properties of the preset: they are WHERE IT
  WORKS, which is the one thing a reader deciding whether to switch it on needs.
  The reason REPLACES the description while it is in force, because the row has
  one line for explaining itself and "why can I not switch this on" is the
  question in front of the reader:
  - `Pick an image in Window background first`
  - `Light theme only — the page is in the dark one`
  - `Dark theme only — the page is in the light one`
  Both facts were already in the payload - `requiresImage`, and `theme` which
  was added to the manifest earlier in this branch - so this is entirely
  `presetsPaneRender` plus a `.pr.off` dim. Verified on the emulator: on a light
  page with a wallpaper, True black and Warm dark are disabled with the reason
  while Sepia and Background image stay live and High contrast (no restriction)
  is untouched; with `data-shell-image` taken away in the DOM only, Background
  image turns disabled with its own reason and back.
  **The same anchoring trap as the comment one, in CSS**: replacing the FIRST
  LINE of a multi-line rule leaves its body dangling - and the balanced-brace
  check does not catch it, because the braces still add up. Anchor on the whole
  rule.
  And the fourth preset in that group says where IT works too: `theme: "both"`
  on `Background image`, because within one group the reader learns "Sepia:
  light", "True black: dark" and needs to know the one that is neither - a set
  of restrictions with one silent member reads as if the fourth were restricted
  too. "Both" is as explicit as the other two, and a preset that says NOTHING
  still says nothing, which is right for the fourteen that are not about a
  theme. The note is ` · light theme` / ` · dark theme` / ` · both themes`,
  appended only while no reason is in force (that reason is about the theme, and
  the line has room for one).
  **And a trap the balanced-brace check cannot see**: `theme` was added to this
  manifest twice - once when the flags went in, once for "both" - and a
  DUPLICATE JSON KEY wins silently by POSITION (Go's Unmarshal takes the last),
  so the page said "light theme" while the file appeared to say both. Run a
  strict parse with `object_pairs_hook` before the build; it is the only check
  that catches it.
- **The theme is TWO buttons now, not a cycle** (the user's design, and it
  closes the loop on this session's first bug). `Auto` and the state it resolves
  to, with the accent marking which of the two is IN FORCE - and that is the one
  thing a cycle could not say: following the phone and pinning a theme are
  different KINDS of answer, and "auto over a light phone" is indistinguishable
  on screen from "pinned light", so moving between them was an invisible press.
  - `setTheme(t)` replaces `cycleTheme`. The `Auto` buttons set `auto`; the state
    buttons set the OPPOSITE of what is on screen, so a tap while Auto is on
    takes over AND switches.
  - `applyThemeControls()` owns the ring (`aria-pressed` on the pair) and the
    glyph, and `syncAutoDark` calls it - the phone can flip the theme under an
    active Auto at sunset and the glyph has to follow.
  - The state button's label names the ACTION, not the state ("Switch to day"):
    while Auto is on the button SHOWS what is on screen and a tap switches, so a
    label reading "Day" would describe the wrong half of the press.
  - Storage is untouched - auto/light/dark - so nothing needs migrating and an
    older build reads the same key. `THEMES` and `cycleTheme` are gone.
  - `#panelTheme` became `.themeSwitch`, and the three display rules that named
    the old id and class (the wide-screen hide, the bar's phone hide, the
    panel's phone show) now name the wrapper.
  - Verified on the emulator by CLICKING the real buttons: auto → ring on Auto,
    glyph ☀, "Switch to night"; tap → stored `dark`, ring on the state button,
    ☾, "Switch to day"; tap → `light`, ring still on it, ☀; tap Auto → back to
    `auto` with the ring on Auto. Every press does something visible.
- **A probe-authoring note for the next session.** Three times in this one I
  wrote a CDP probe ending `}})'''` for `JSON.stringify((function(){…})` - one
  closing paren short - and each time the result read as a page error
  ("Uncaught", "SyntaxError") when it was the probe. Check the expression's own
  parens before believing a red result.
- **Font weight joined Font size** (the user's ask), and it is the size's twin
  all the way down: `--wd-fw` on the root, read by the article's shadow style
  (`font-weight:var(--wd-fw,400)`), BAKED into the frames' srcdoc and also sent
  to them as `{t:"fw",w}` - a custom property cannot cross a document boundary,
  which is why the size has both routes too. Persisted as `ui.fontWeight` in
  `state.json` (a new field on UIPrefs), so it follows the person rather than
  the browser, exactly as the size does.
  - Three steps and no more: 400/500/700, named Normal/Medium/Bold. The faces in
    the stack a dictionary is read in - Roboto, SF, Segoe - have those reliably,
    and 300 is either missing or SYNTHESISED, which reads as a mistake rather
    than as lighter text.
  - The same stepper as the size, with its value button showing the NAME rather
    than the number: the reader is choosing a look, not a value.
  - The existing `bolder_text` preset is NOT a weight - it is
    `-webkit-text-stroke:.2px` - so the two coexist rather than overlap: a stroke
    thickens any face by a fixed amount, a weight picks another face.
  - Verified on the emulator: 400 Normal → 500 Medium → 700 Bold, the bounds dim
    (`.lim`, the app's dim-not-disable rule), tapping the value resets, and the
    value button is wide enough for its word ("Normal" 44px, "Medium" 48px
    natural) instead of clipping it.
  - **The styles were then NOT shared** (the user's follow-up: "apply the same
    styles to Font weight as to Font size - colour and so on"). All seven
    stepper rules were scoped to `#fsCtl` alone, so the weight control got
    none of it: no colour, no border, no 22px box, no hover, no focus ring,
    and its `.lim` never dimmed anything. Both containers are named in every
    rule now — `#fsCtl button,#fwCtl button` and so on, NOT
    `#fsCtl,#fwCtl button`, which reads as "the size CONTAINER or a weight
    button" and strips the size of its own sizing.
  - The two rows also read as one column now: the label is 60px (the longer of
    "Font size"/"Font weight") and `.fsval` is 48px (the wider of "32px" and
    "Medium"), so both − buttons and both + buttons sit at the same x.
    Scoped with `.facts:has(>#fsCtl)` / `:has(>#fwCtl)` so the panel's other
    `.facts` rows — which put their control at the right edge — cannot move;
    checked, and these are the only two `.rowlabel`s in the document.
  - **Verified in the page's own raster** (`Page.captureScreenshot`, clip +
    PIL, not the screenshot read by eye — which at that zoom said the opposite):
    the border columns of the two rows are identical to a tenth of a CSS px —
    `−` at 214.2, value box 238.2–285.5, `+` at 288.2–309.5 — and all six
    buttons compute the same colour, border and font-size. The weight's `−`
    reads fainter in the raster only because Normal is the floor (`.lim`).
    Note for the next raster probe: `clip.scale` MULTIPLIES the DPR, so
    `scale:2` on a 2x device is 4 device px per CSS px, not 2.
  - **Both themes checked**, and the pair is right in each: with the paper
    wallpaper on, the light theme computes ink `#5d4d3a` and line `#cdbb96`
    (the BACKGROUND preset's warm inks) and the dark theme `#ded8cc` and
    `rgba(230,220,201,.4)` (the sepia-dark override at app.css:392). The
    steppers only read the vars, so they needed nothing of their own.
  - **A probe trap this cost me.** Reading `getComputedStyle` on the buttons in
    the SAME evaluate that called `setTheme("dark")` returned the LIGHT values,
    while the root's `--fg` and the panel's own colour in that same read were
    already dark. I nearly recorded a dark-mode ink bug that does not exist.
    Set the theme in one call, measure in the next.
- **Not done**: nothing is committed; `README`/`pages/docs` still describe one
  stylesheet; and the Files tab stayed in Custom CSS, on the reasoning that it
  manages the files the App and Article sheets reference (its labels say "used
  in App/Article") - say the word if it should be a subject of its own.

## The theme button said "night" in daylight (2026-09-25, this session)

Reported from the phone: at launch the button beside the ✕ showed night while
the app was light, the first press changed nothing, and the second turned night
on. All three are one cause, and the cycle itself is fine: the stored mode is
`auto`, whose glyph was `◐` — at this size a black half-disc that reads as a
MOON. So `auto` announced night; the first press is `auto → light` and both are
light over a light system, so nothing moved; the second is `light → dark`.

- **`auto` now shows `☀☾`** — "follows day and night". It says what the state
  actually is, it cannot be read as night, and every press of the cycle is now
  visible. `light` stays ☀, `dark` stays ☾.
- **Verified on the emulator**, all three: auto → `☀☾` (41px) with a light page;
  light → `☀` (32px), light; dark → `☾` (27px), dark. Titles are
  "Theme: auto — following the system" / "Theme: light" / "Theme: dark".
- **A page can never be light while the glyph is ☾**: `dark` sets
  `data-theme=dark` and the crescent together. Checked by driving all three
  through localStorage and reading the resolved `data-dark` and the text colour,
  so the report could only have been the glyph.
- **The old glyph was named in two documents** — README's shortcut list and
  `pages/docs/start/search.md`. Both updated; the docs page is upstream's, so
  that one line is a trivial conflict owed on the next sync.

## The Settings panel: one shape per setting, and a door that names itself (2026-09-24, this session)

Three reports from the phone: the Results strip's controls were unlike each
other and wrapped into whatever column the width allowed, "Highlight matches"
was a lone toggle among two pairs, and the Appearance section named its door
after the heading it sits under.

- **The Results strip is a column of same-shaped rows.** `.facts.reading` is
  `flex-direction:column;align-items:flex-start`; every control is a `.seg` — a
  label, then a pair of buttons. Measured on the device: three rows at x=147,
  y=339/368/398, all 367 wide, no overflow.
- **`#hlBtn` is gone**; it is `#hlOn`/`#hlOff` now, wired through the same
  `for(const [id,want] of [...])` shape the other two pairs use. So `applyHL`
  returns `moved` and the search re-runs only on a real change — the old single
  toggle always moved, so it always re-ran. Its inline `style.color` went with
  it (the accent on the pressed half is the `.seg` CSS's job), and so did the
  highlighter's pen: the label it now wears says the same thing in the register
  the other two labels use.
- **The Appearance door is `Screen, background, CSS…`** — it names the sheet's
  three groups instead of repeating the heading above it. The heading, the
  sheet's own title, and the element's id and `title` are unchanged.
- **Verified on the emulator**: the rows stack and their labels share one x;
  clicking Off then On flips `aria-pressed` both ways; `hlOff` still
  round-trips through state.json; `go build ./...` and the asset tests pass.
- **The rows are ONE column, and it is the sheet's column** (two reports from
  the user, the second with a picture). As built first, `.facts .seg>span
  {flex:1 1 auto}` made the label a spring: it took the row's slack and pinned
  the pair to the right edge (x=514) while each pair kept the natural width of
  its own two words, so the three rows started at 447/394/368 — "On | Off"
  could not be read as the same control as "Alphabetical | My order". Then:
  "like the font controls — move them left". So the label is a fixed column
  now — `flex:0 1 96px;min-width:0`, with an ellipsis below that — and it is
  the SAME 96px the two font rows' labels take, which puts every control in
  the panel at one x: measured, labels 147..243 and pairs and both steppers
  starting at 249/250. Same at 411 and 360. `flex-shrink` and the ellipsis are
  what a narrow phone gets instead of the old squeezed label.
- **Both halves of a pair are the same width**: `min-width:80px;
  justify-content:center` on `.facts .seg .act`. 80 and not 79, which is what
  `Alphabetical` measures (79.33) and which left that one row a pixel out of
  line. `.facts` exists only in index.html and only those six buttons are
  `.act`s inside a `.seg`, so nothing else in the app can move.
- **Below 345px the pair wraps under its label**, and only there, in a media
  query. Not a permanent `flex-wrap`: a wrapping flex container reserves the
  height of a second line whether or not it uses one — measured, the row went
  from 22px to 51px at EVERY width, a lot of panel for the narrowest phones
  only. Verified at 320/345/360/411/540: no overflow at any of them and 22px
  rows everywhere above the query.
- **A raster trap that cost me a detour**: a clipped `Page.captureScreenshot`
  came back as a stitched frame — the labels drawn twice, the buttons cut off
  mid-word — while the DOM said everything was in place. The compositor had
  stale tiles. `adb exec-out screencap -p` plus a PIL crop is the reliable
  picture; the page raster is for measuring pixel columns, and even then the
  DOM rects are what settle a question.
- **The embedded assets are CRLF**, so a byte search in `libwudict.so` for a
  multi-line CSS snippet must include the `\r\n`. Searching for one cost me a
  rebuilt APK I thought had not been rebuilt — the single-line probes matched,
  the multi-line one did not.

## The chips name their scope, with no receding state (2026-09-24, this session)

Two reports from the phone, one cause: `.chip.dflt`, which upstream gave the
"all" scope because All was a MODE there (the picker's All/Found toggle). This
fork removed that toggle — its picker has one mode — so "All dictionaries" is
an ordinary group, and a state that hides its own name and fades to the faint
colour no longer describes anything.

- **`.chip.dflt` is gone** — both rules and both `classList.toggle("dflt", …)`
  call sites. What is left is `#dictChip,#modeChip{background:none;
  color:var(--fg)}`: no accent tint, no receding state, one look in every mode
  and every scope.
- **`syncChips` names the all-scope** like any group. The only nameless state
  left is the transient where a saved id is not in the `<select>` yet, and it
  shows the bare glyph. `groupLabel()` already returned "All dictionaries" for
  the same value, so the chip now agrees with the rest of the page.
- **Measured on the device**: `all`, `g:dir:mono` and back to `all` all give
  `rgba(0,0,0,0)` + `rgb(59,50,41)`.
- **The name is shortened for the chip, not dropped.** "All dictionaries" is 16
  characters, the chip's cap is 11ch, and the cap cannot grow — a chip wide
  enough for the full name would leave the 320px field about 25px. So the chip
  says "All" (`SCOPE_SHORT`), the same bargain `MODE_SHORT` already strikes for
  "starts with", and the picker's list keeps the full wording exactly as the
  mode dropdown does.
- **The cost is the field**: the bare glyph was 40px and "All" is 49px, so the
  all-scope takes 9px rather than the 31px the full name would have. 320px goes
  118 → 101px, 540px goes 338 → 321px; a group name still renders at the 71px
  cap, and nothing overflows at 320/360/412/540.

## The mode chip looks the same in every mode (2026-09-24, this session)

Superseded by the above, kept because the reasoning is the same one: `.chip.dflt`
receded the mode chip to the faint colour while the mode was the default and
wore the accent tint otherwise, so the control the reader taps most often was
drawn as if it were off.

## The search bar's four controls are separated now (2026-09-24, this session)

Reported from the phone: the pill draws ONE frame around the pin, the field,
the mode chip and the dictionary chip, and inside it nothing said where one
control ended and the next began — the pin has no fill, the field is borderless
by design, and a chip wears a background only when it is NOT the default.
`.pill>*+*` now carries a hairline and .45em of left padding, and
`.pill .qled` moved with it (it sat flush with the field's edge).

- **The colour is `--line`**, so the hairline follows whatever theme or host
  background is in force — measured `#cdbb96` under the emulator's sepia +
  wallpaper + presets, not a fixed grey.
- **Measured on the device**: three 1px borders, all 32px tall (the pill's own
  inner height), at x=47/397/458; the glyph and the field both at x=56. No
  overflow at 320/360/412/540px; the field gives the separators ~19px at every
  width and still holds 118px at 320px.
- **Not touched**: the native mode/dictionary picker. An emulator screenshot
  made it look as if it painted white instead of the host background — the
  install's own presets (`background_image`, `compact`) had simply not applied
  at that moment, and with them on the dialog wears the background as designed.

## The Browse page wears the host background now (2026-09-24, this session)

Both doors — `Browse A–Z…` in the Settings panel (which lands on the chooser)
and a card's `Browse` in Dictionary settings (`?dict=<id>`, the word list) — are
ONE page in two states, and `browse.html` was the only page that did not wear
the host background. It now carries setup.html's/lemmas.html's hook and recipe.

- **The hook runs from sessionStorage, not from the URL.** This page is reached
  by TAPPING A LINK inside the WebView, so it never carries `shell_bg`/
  `shell_image`; what fires is the pair the app page wrote there (its own
  `applyBackground` runs on every `onPageFinished`). The URL half is kept
  because the sibling pages spell it and a reload of a page opened with it must
  not lose it.
- **It is the PAGES' recipe, not the app windows':** the page goes transparent
  over what the host paints, its surfaces stay translucent
  (`rgba(255,255,255,.14)` for the bar and the chooser card — the bar keeps its
  blur and loses its 94% fill), and the palette follows the TONE of the colour
  the host sent. `#styler`/`.menu-card` wear a different one (`--paper-bg` +
  `--paper-bk-image`) because they are surfaces drawn INSIDE the app.
- **The tone rules are `html:root[tone]`, not `html[tone]` — load-bearing.**
  This page's own dark blocks are `:root:not([data-theme=light])` and
  `:root[data-theme=dark]`, both (0,2,0); a bare `html[data-shell-tone=…]` is
  (0,1,1) and would LOSE, putting light text on a light paper. The type
  selector makes it (0,2,1). Verified on the device under an emulated dark
  system preference AND with `wudict_theme=dark` pinned — the tone still wins.
- **Scoped, not global**: with the three attributes removed the page computes
  exactly what it did before (`body` `#fbfaf8`, `--bar` `rgba(251,250,248,.94)`).
- **Verified on the emulator** (which turned out to have five indexed
  dictionaries): the chooser and `?dict=f24921fc1083` (300 word links, 29 chips)
  both report a transparent body, `rgba(255,255,255,.14)` bar and card, word
  links `#4d6b86`, `--bg` `#edd1a6`; the screenshots read correctly.
- **Left alone**: `browse.html` keeps its own palette and its own dark-mode
  handling for the no-background case, and still does not load `setup.css` —
  that sheet centres a single card, and this page is a full-bleed list.

## The colour window flickered on every launch (2026-09-24, this session)

Reported from the phone as "the colour picker window flashes when the app
starts", with video frames of it. The shell has no native colour picker, so it
is the page's `#colorDialog` — and it is not being OPENED: a trap on
`showModal`/`show`/the `open` property, installed before the page's own scripts
run, recorded nothing. It is being PAINTED.

- **Cause**: `app.css`'s `.panel-card` — the ☰ drawer's card, a class the four
  `<dialog class="group-dialog panel-card">`s also wear — sets `display:flex`.
  An author `display` outranks the user-agent's `dialog:not([open]){display:none}`
  whatever either specificity is, so a CLOSED dialog is drawn. The windows' own
  guard is `dialog.group-dialog:not([open]){display:none}` in
  `group-editor.css`, and index.html links that sheet at the END of `<body>`, so
  it arrives after the windows have been parsed. Measured over CDP: at 58 ms
  `#colorDialog` computed `display:flex` at 420x209 and `#dictSettings` at
  420x94, both gone by 63 ms. A phone spends long enough on the same two
  requests to read it as a flicker, which is why only the colour window was
  reported — it is the one of the two with content already in the markup.
- **Fix**: the same guard added to `app.css` beside `.panel-card` — in the sheet
  that INTRODUCES the display, not the one that owns the windows.
  `group-editor.css` keeps its copy with a note that neither may be dropped
  alone.
- **Verified on the emulator** (the debug APK installs there now): after the fix,
  338 frames over 6 s with no window ever painted, and both windows still open
  through their real paths — `colorDialogOpen` → `flex` 508x286,
  `showDictSettings` → `flex` 508x928 — and close back to `display:none`.
- **Recipe worth reusing**: `adb forward tcp:9222 localabstract:webview_devtools_remote_<pid>`
  (the pid changes on every app start), then `Page.addScriptToEvaluateOnNewDocument`
  + `Page.reload` to instrument BEFORE the page's scripts, and sample
  `getComputedStyle` per `requestAnimationFrame` for the first seconds — a
  one-frame flash is invisible to `screencap` in a loop and to the eye's own
  timing. This machine's python3 has no `websocket` module, so the client is
  written over `socket` by hand (~60 lines); the app's own server is on 6889 and
  its devtools target is a `page` called `wudict`.
- **Left as found**: the same author-`display`-beats-`hidden` trap is documented
  in app.css for `#styler [hidden]` and guarded per element. `#colorDialog` is
  NOT inside `#styler` (its `</div>` closes the sheet first), so that rule was
  never going to cover it — checked, not assumed.

## The launcher icon carries a "2" now (2026-09-22, this session)

The user asked for a "2" in the bottom-left corner of the wuDict2 icon ("рядом с
луппой", i.e. next to the lens) and listed four file paths they believed were
the icon. Two really are it: the Play listing's `icon.png` and
`featureGraphic.png`. The other two, `internal/tray/icons/{tray,tray-template}.png`,
are the DESKTOP systray's — rendered from `internal/server/web/favicon.svg` by
`tools/make-icons.sh` — and the phone's actual icon is not a PNG at all:
`android/app/src/main/res/drawable/ic_launcher_foreground.xml`, a
VectorDrawable, which their list did not contain.

- **Changed**: that VectorDrawable (the phone's adaptive + monochrome icon) and
  the two Play PNGs, rendered from the same mark. The digit's geometry, the mark
  rules it is composed against and its clearances are stated in both files'
  comments — not restated here.
- **Where the digit lives**: the VectorDrawable, and `tools/make-icons.sh`, which
  derives the Play renders from `favicon.svg` by substitution (the technique that
  script already uses for the macOS template) so an upstream change to the mark
  still reaches them. The digit is the only thing written down twice; both
  comments say so.
- **Left alone on purpose**: `favicon.svg` and its `pages/docs/assets/` copies,
  the tray PNGs, `packaging/*.icns|.ico`. Those are all 16–32px renditions, where
  a digit is a smudge, and they belong to the shared web/desktop artifacts of a
  fork that ships no desktop build. If the mark should change ALL the way, it is
  one `make icons` run plus the three SVG copies — but that is a permanent merge
  cost on upstream files. The user's list included the tray pair; that is why.
- **Verified**: the VectorDrawable's own XML was converted back to SVG and
  rendered against the intended drawing — RMSE 0.015, which is the lens's
  circle-vs-two-arcs antialiasing and nothing else, so the path on the phone's
  icon is the designed one. `tools/make-icons.sh` ran end-to-end in a throwaway
  tree with its `rsvg-convert` calls shimmed onto ImageMagick's librsvg delegate
  (this machine has no librsvg) and produced BOTH Play PNGs pixel-identical to
  the committed pair (`compare -metric RMSE` 0). The store images' canvases and
  mark scales were measured off the pair they replace (glyph box 2/3 of the 512
  icon, 300px wide in the 1024×500 graphic, both centred, both on full-bleed
  `#4c6680`), and a digit-less re-render of the feature graphic reproduced the
  old committed file to RMSE 3.2e-05.
- **Owed**: nothing was built or installed, so no device has shown the new
  launcher icon, its themed monochrome form, or the store listing. Static checks
  pass: `sh -n tools/make-icons.sh`, the vector's XML parse, `git diff --check`.
- **Found while working, left as found**: `tools/make-icons.sh` exits early when
  `iconutil` is missing (upstream's own behaviour), so on a machine without
  macOS tools `make icons` never reaches the Windows `.ico` section either. The
  new Play section was placed BEFORE that guard on purpose, so it runs anywhere.

## Dictionary word list → article, and the picker it lands in (2026-09-21, this session)

The user's task: in the Dictionary settings window every dictionary has a
**Browse** link, which opens that dictionary's word list, and **clicking a word
must open the standard view with that word shown**. What it turned out to be is
the answer to `docs/OPEN.md` **O13**, whose open question was exactly "is the
jump out of the word list enough (then nothing is built), or must the picker
itself offer a single dictionary". The jump was already there and was verified
rather than written; the picker half then came back — in the same message — in a
narrower form, and THAT is what this session changed: three edits in
`internal/server/web/index.html`, all of them about what the picker window says
and lists. No Java, no Go, no CSS, no `browse.html`.

- **What the path is**: the card's `/browse?dict=<id>` (`index.html:1548`, drawn
  only while the dictionary is indexed) → `browse.html`, whose every word is
  `/?q=<word>&dict=<id>&mode=exact` (`browse.html:217`) → `applyURL`
  (`index.html:3621`) sets `#mode`, sets `#dict` to that id and runs the search
  through the normal `doSearch`, so the scope is the app's own `dict=` scope.
- **Verified** (throwaway server on 127.0.0.1:6899, temp config + db dir,
  `test_data/`'s three dictionaries, desktop Chromium; server killed and the
  temp dir deleted afterwards), each step read off the live page:
  - all three cards carry a `Browse` link whose id is the one `/api/dicts` and
    `/api/browse` use;
  - the word list's anchors are `/?q=…&dict=…&mode=exact`, 300 per page;
  - clicking a word lands on `/?q=act&mode=exact&dict=56c232b0aaa1` with
    `#mode`=exact, `#dict`=that id and the chip naming that dictionary;
  - **the scope is real, not cosmetic**: the same word searched unscoped
    (`dict=all`) renders **two** sections (Asperger + Oxford), and the
    jump renders **one** — that dictionary's;
  - a Cyrillic headword survives the round trip
    (`а вместе с ним и` → `Zimmerman (Ru-En)`, 1 result);
  - Back from the article returns to the word list with its page
    (`/browse?dict=…&p=1`), because the jump records itself with `replaceState`
    and the word list's own page turn pushed.
- **Not verified on the phone, and the reason is a rule, not an oversight**: the
  installed APK (`wudict2-v0.1.0-25-g653c36a-dirty`, i.e. built from this tree,
  installed 2026-09-21 22:12) is a **release** build, so `setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(BuildConfig.DEBUG)`
  leaves no `webview_devtools_remote_*` socket to attach to, and installing a
  debug build needs the user's word. The phone's server also answers 401
  without its access key, which is not ours to read. So the device pass is owed,
  and it is listed in `docs/ANDROID-UI-HANDOFF.md`.
- **Two observations left alone on purpose** (both written up in O13): the
  browse page's magnifier is `<a href="/">` — it loads the app with no query and
  leaves the word list on the history stack, the shape the user rejected on
  `/setup` and `/lemmas`, but here Back is the returning path and the magnifier
  says "Back to search"; and `browse.html` is the one page that does not wear
  the shell background (its own palette, its own dark-mode handling), which the
  other two pages do. Neither is a gap in the flow that was asked for.
- **One defect found in code that was already there, and then FIXED on the
  user's word** (all of it in `internal/server/web/index.html`): `livePickerRows()`
  filtered the answered dictionaries by the picker's own group
  (`new Set(activeUserGroupIds())`), so a view scoped to a dictionary that is
  **not a member of that group** rendered its article while the native picker
  received `rows: []` and `empty: "No results in this group"`. Reproduced on the
  throwaway server with a one-dictionary user group ("Russian only", holding
  Zimmerman) and `localStorage.wudict_picker_group` set to it: the jump to
  `/?q=act&mode=exact&dict=56c232b0aaa1` (Asperger, not a member) rendered **one**
  section, `#dict`/`#dictLbl` named Asperger, and `livePickerRows()` returned `[]`.
  The filter was redundant wherever the scope is chosen from the page (a scope of
  `all` or of a group is already resolved to that group's members *before* the
  search is sent), so all it could do was hide a row that was on screen — the
  filter is gone, and the comment in `livePickerRows` says why it must not come
  back.
- **The picker's dropdown now names the dictionary being searched** (the user's
  second ask in the same message): `scopedDictionary()` contributes
  `{id:"d:<id>", name:<dict label>}` to the payload's `groups`, spliced under
  "All dictionaries", and it is the payload's current `group` whenever the
  standing scope is one dictionary. **Derived, never stored** — no `state.json`,
  no `/api/groups`, no group editor, nothing in localStorage — so "when do we
  take it out" needs no mechanism: it is recomputed from the scope on every open
  and is gone the moment the scope is anything else. `wudictPickerGroupChanged`
  had to change with it: its "already current, do nothing" guard compared the tap
  against `pickerGroup`, which is a *stored fallback* in this state, so picking
  the reader's own standing group out of a scoped view would have been swallowed
  and the next payload would have put the spinner back on the dictionary — it now
  compares against what the spinner SHOWS (`scopedDictionary()`). `empty` also
  branches: "No results in this dictionary" when scoped, "No results in this
  group" otherwise. A `d:` id is unreachable as a selection (it is only ever the
  current entry) and fails the membership guard, so no `doSearch` resolver was
  added — `docs/OPEN.md` O13 carries that correction to its original sketch.
- **The caret no longer lands in the search field when a page arrives with `?q=`**
  (the user's follow-up: `history.js` opens its dropdown on the field's `focus`,
  so a word opened from the word list came up with the history drawn over the
  article — "this history must show only on manual input"). The cause was the
  boot focus rule inside `setPhase` (`index.html`), and neither of the two
  obvious suspects was involved: the `autofocus` attribute is dropped by the
  browser because the input is `disabled` while the page parses (measured:
  `activeElement` is BODY at `domcontentloaded`), and the shell's
  `wantAutoFocus` is armed only for a cold start with no query. The rule ran
  when the dictionary list became usable, where a deep link's field is still
  EMPTY — `applyURL`, which fills it and searches, is chained after that — so
  "an empty field means nothing to read" handed the caret to the word the reader
  had come to READ. It now has a third condition, checked on the URL rather than
  on the field: `!new URLSearchParams(location.search).get("q")`.
- **Verified after the fix**, read off the live page: `?q=act&mode=exact&dict=…`
  leaves `activeElement` at BODY with the article rendered and no dropdown —
  for a fresh load, for a click on a word in the word list, and for a Cyrillic
  word; an empty start and a `?dict=`-only start still take the caret (that is
  the "just type" intent); a hand-typed word still opens the dropdown with its
  matches; and `searchFor` — the path a double-clicked word takes, which the
  user pointed at as the model — leaves the caret alone, which is now what a
  `?q=` arrival does too.
- **The picker changes were verified in the desktop browser** on the same
  throwaway server, read off the live page: the scoped payload is
  `group:"d:…"`, `groups:[All Dictionaries, the dictionary, Russian only]`,
  `rows:[that dictionary]`, `empty:"No results in this
  dictionary"`, with one section rendered; picking the standing group out of that
  state resets the scope to all (`#dict`="all", the URL's `dict` back to `all`,
  the chip cleared, pickerGroup saved, search re-run — the tap the old guard would
  have eaten); picking "All dictionaries" from the same state does the same and
  the unscoped answer comes back (2 sections); the entry disappears from `groups`
  in both; choosing a dictionary in the `#dict` select (the desktop route) yields
  the same derived entry; a one-shot cross-dictionary-link scope (`searchFor` with
  a scope) leaves the standing scope at "all" — no entry in the dropdown, but the
  answered dictionary IS the one row, which is the fix above; `/api/groups` still
  returns only the two real groups, localStorage holds no `d:` value, and reading
  the payload changes no scope. `git diff --check`, `go build ./...` and
  `go test ./internal/server -run 'TestScriptsAreContentAddressed|TestAssetCacheHeaders|TestIndexTracksTheUserStylesheet' -count=1`
  all pass.
- **The Java side needed no change at all** — `DictionaryPicker.Live` renders
  whatever `groups`/`group`/`rows`/`empty` the payload carries, so the new entry
  is just another spinner row to it. That also means the phone has to confirm it:
  the spinner should read the dictionary while a word view is open, and the two
  ways out of it (the group, "All dictionaries") should work from there. No APK
  was built or installed.
- **No APK, nothing built or installed; `go build ./...` was run for the
  throwaway server only.**

## The Settings drawer has five sections now (2026-09-21, stage 1)

The user's plan for "bringing the panel into order": a `Dictionaries` section
at the top carrying the real counts and the doors, a section for how results
are shown, `Appearance`, `History`, `Info`. Four design questions were asked
and answered before the work (all four took the recommendation): the second
section is called **Results**, `Edit folders…` **and** `Rescan folders` both
moved into the panel, History got its own section, and the headings are
STATIC (nothing folds — the markup says why). Nothing was built for the phone;
the user builds and checks there.

- **What the drawer was**: one `<details>` called "Folders & setup" holding the
  folder paths, the search-history controls, `Browse A–Z…`, `Appearance…` and
  the About block, with the text-size stepper living inside its `<summary>` —
  so the machine's doors, the reading controls and the reference paths read as
  one undifferentiated column.
- **What it is now** (`internal/server/web/index.html`, one `<section
  class="sect">` per subject, in this order): `Dictionaries` (the
  `#folderSummary` line — `N folders · M dictionaries` from `/api/config`,
  unchanged code — then one `.mrow` per door: `#editDictSettings`,
  `#editGroups`, `#editFolders`, `#rescanBtn`, `#lemmaLink`); `Results`
  (`#hlBtn`, the Open-first and Sort segs, `#browseLink`); `Appearance`
  (`#fsCtl` with a `Font size` label, then `#stylerLink`); `History`
  (`#historyLength` + `#clearHistory`); `Info` (`#folderBody` — the paths —
  then the `.about` block). Every id, handler and href is unchanged — the doors
  are the same elements in new places, so no JS behaviour moved.
- **Then two corrections from the user's look at it** (same day, the count line
  and the paths): the **cog before the counts is gone**, so the line is text
  and nothing else — no disclosure, no target, nothing drawn as a control; and
  **the paths moved out of `Dictionaries` into `Info`**, with their group
  headings in **sentence case** ("Dictionary folders", "Library", "Config
  file" — they were lowercase in JS and uppercased by CSS; both are now normal
  case, `font-weight:600` is what marks them as headings). The `<details
  id="folders">` element is therefore gone entirely: no folding, and with it
  `localStorage.wudict_folders`, the `toggle` listener and the lazy-load path
  (`showPanel` already calls `loadFolders()` on every open, which is what fills
  the block). `#folders .grp/.frow/.rv/.warn` became `#folderBody …`; the
  count's rules became `.counts`.
- **Doors vs actions, as a rule**: a door is a full-width row with a chevron
  (`›`) on the right; the one row that ACTS where it stands (`Rescan folders`)
  has no chevron and keeps its ⟳ glyph instead. That is the whole reason
  `#rescanBtn` is the only row without the marker.
- **The settings window lost three of its four toolbar commands.** `Edit
  folders…`, `Rescan folders` and `Lemmatization…` are per-COLLECTION, not per
  card, so they moved to the panel's `Dictionaries` section — the user's own
  argument: adding a folder is how dictionaries arrive, so the thing that
  configures what appeared belongs one row away. `Full-text for every
  dictionary…` stays, because it is the bulk form of the per-card switches
  directly under it.
- **CSS**: `.sect` / `.sect-h` (heading + hairline, the last section without
  one), `.facts .mrow` / `.mrow.door` / `.facts .rowlabel` and `.counts` are new
  in `app.css`. The stepper's rules moved from `#folders .fs*` to `#fsCtl*`, the
  paths' from `#folders .grp/.frow/.rv/.warn` to `#folderBody …`, and the bare
  `.about` rules became `.sect .about` — **load-bearing**, because `.about` is
  also the class of a card's "About this dictionary" disclosure further down,
  whose links a bare `.about a` would have restyled.
- **The stepper's click-suppression handler is gone** (`$("fsCtl")…
  preventDefault/stopPropagation`): it existed only because the stepper sat
  inside a `<summary>`, whose toggle is a click's default action. The row is a
  plain div now. The dimming at the bounds (`.lim`) stayed, and its comment now
  says what actually holds the range (clamping in `applyFS`).
- **Comments were rewritten, not just moved**: this file's markup comments are
  the design record, so the ones that justified the old single-`details`
  layout, the "no Font size label" rule (the label fits now), the glyph choices
  for `Edit folders…`/`Lemmatization…` (their rows are labelled doors now, so
  the folder and stem glyphs are gone; the ⟳ on Rescan is the only glyph left in
  the panel) and the reading strip's "no heading over them" all had to say
  something true about the new shape.
- **Verified** (throwaway server on 127.0.0.1:6899, temp config + db dir,
  `test_data/`, desktop Chromium; server killed and the temp dir deleted
  afterwards): five sections in order with the right headings, the last one
  without a hairline; seven `.mrow` rows, all one line tall at 320px with **no**
  horizontal overflow and no row overflowing its box; the chevrons present on
  doors and `none` on `#rescanBtn` (computed `::after`); `#folderSummary`
  reading "1 folder · 3 dictionaries" as a **plain** line (`.counts`, no svg, no
  `<details>` anywhere in the panel) with the paths drawn in `Info` — the three
  group headings in sentence case (`text-transform: none`, weight 600) and the
  three path rows visible without unfolding; `#editDictSettings` opening the
  modal window (3 cards, `:modal`, toolbar holding `#ftsAllBtn` only) and
  `#ftsAllBtn` opening its box ("Index 3 dictionaries" / Cancel);
  `#editGroups` opening the group editor; the stepper's two presses taking
  `--wd-fs` 15px → 17px, updating `#fsVal` and persisting `ui.fontSize=17`
  server-side; no duplicate ids anywhere in the page; the inline script still
  parsing (the panel and the picker functions all present). `go build ./...`,
  `git diff --check` and
  `go test ./internal/server -run 'TestScriptsAreContentAddressed|TestAssetCacheHeaders|TestIndexTracksTheUserStylesheet'`
  pass. No APK built or installed — the phone pass is owed.
- **Known cosmetic question, left for the user**: the `Appearance` heading and
  the `Appearance…` row inside it now say the same word. Renaming either (the
  row could name what the sheet holds — the screen edges, the window
  background, the user's CSS) is a one-line change if they want it.

## The picker has one mode: Found (2026-09-21)

The user's instruction: the Dictionary picker All/Found toggle goes away,
the app works in Found mode only, and no saved state or code path may switch
it back. Nothing was built for this session (the user builds and checks on
the phone); the verification is below.

- **Removed from `internal/server/web/index.html`**: the panel row
  (`<span class="seg hidden" id="dictionaryPickerMode">` with `#pickerAll` /
  `#pickerFound`), its two `app.css` rules (`#dictionaryPickerMode{flex-basis:100%}`
  and `#dictionaryPickerMode.hidden{display:none}`), `window.wudictSetDictionaryMode`
  together with the click wiring that kept its pairs of `aria-pressed`, and
  `window.wudictFoundDictionaryPicker` — the `window.prompt` twin of the
  native picker, which the shell could never reach anyway (see the retired
  note below). The mode variable `window.wudictFoundDictionaryMode` is gone
  from the page.
- **What the single list is**: `livePickerRows()` now always returns the
  dictionaries that ANSWERED the current search, in the order their sections
  appear, filtered to the picker's group; `livePickerPayload()` always sends
  `found:true` and always the found wording of `empty` ("Searching…" / "No
  results in this group"), and no longer sends `selected` (that field was the
  All-mode "chosen dictionary"); `wudictPickerDictionarySelected` always opens
  the section and scrolls to it. The Java side is untouched on purpose:
  `found:true` only chooses the presentation (plain rows, no radio circles)
  in `DictionaryPicker.Live`, and `show()` still needs its `found` flag false
  for `mode` / `stylerPreset` / `groupSelect`.
- **Removed from the shell**: the mode injection in `Shell.applyBackground`
  (it read `ShellPrefs.foundDictionaries`), the `wudict:dictionary-mode`
  prompt handler in `Shell.windows().onJsPrompt`, the unreachable found
  branch in `DICTIONARY_PICKER_JS`, and `ShellPrefs.FOUND_DICTIONARIES` +
  `foundDictionaries()`. The stored `found_dictionaries` boolean is simply no
  longer read — a value written by an older build cannot change anything, and
  nothing has to be migrated or erased.
- **Consequence worth knowing**: a single-dictionary search scope can no
  longer be set from the picker (that was the All-mode radio list). Groups
  still scope the search, cross-dictionary links and `?dict=` URLs still scope
  a view, and picking a group in the picker resets the scope to all. The user
  then raised how a single-dictionary scope should be chosen at all (their
  sketch: a group holding one dictionary, added on demand, driven from a
  word-list window) — that design question went to `docs/OPEN.md` as **O13**,
  which recorded the fact that matters most: the entry point already exists
  (`Browse A–Z…` → `browse.html` → `/?q=<word>&dict=<id>`), so nothing needs
  to be built for "show this word in this dictionary". **O13 is now CLOSED**
  (see the section below): the user answered with the jump, and it was verified
  rather than built.
- **Verified** (throwaway server on 127.0.0.1:6899, temp config + db dir,
  `test_data/`'s three .dsl.dz, desktop Chromium; server killed and its temp
  dir deleted afterwards): the page's inline script parses and runs —
  `wudictNativeDictionaryPicker`, `livePickerRows`, `livePickerPayload` and
  `wudictPickerDictionarySelected` are all functions, while
  `wudictFoundDictionaryPicker`, `wudictSetDictionaryMode` and
  `wudictFoundDictionaryMode` are all `undefined`; `#pickerAll`,
  `#pickerFound` and `#dictionaryPickerMode` do not exist; the panel's only
  segments are **Open first** and **Sort dictionaries** (its button ids are
  `openOrder`, `openFast`, `sortAZ`, `sortOwn`); after a real search for
  "time" the live payload reads `{found:true, group:"all", empty:"No results
  in this group", rows:[Asperger…, Oxford…]}` — the two dictionaries that
  answered, with no `selected` key. Also: `go build ./...`, `git diff --check`,
  `go test ./internal/server -run 'TestScriptsAreContentAddressed|TestAssetCacheHeaders|TestIndexTracksTheUserStylesheet'`
  and `:app:compileFossDebugJavaWithJavac --offline` all pass. No APK was
  built or installed; the device pass (panel rows, the picker's list and the
  jump) is still owed — it is listed in `docs/ANDROID-UI-HANDOFF.md`.

## Retired: picker scroll speed note (2026-09-21, earlier the same session)

The user asked whether the picker's jump to a dictionary can be instant
instead of animated. It can, and the lever is the system's, not the app's.

- Three call sites in `internal/server/web/index.html` are written
  `behavior:lessMotion.matches?"auto":"smooth"`: 1094 (the picker's jump,
  the one a tap now runs), 1112 (tap on a section's summary) and 3385
  (`revealAt`). No `scroll-behavior` rule exists anywhere in `web/` (only
  `overscroll-behavior`), so `"auto"` really is an instant jump rather than a
  CSS-requested glide.
- **On Android, `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` IS "animator duration scale
  == 0"** — verified in Chromium source, not from memory:
  `ui/accessibility/android/java/src/org/chromium/ui/accessibility/AccessibilityState.java`
  has `prefersReducedMotion() { return getAnimatorDurationScale() == 0.0; }`,
  and `AccessibilityStateDelegateImpl` reads
  `Settings.Global.ANIMATOR_DURATION_SCALE` (default 1f) with a
  ContentObserver on it. That impl is also what `getDelegate()` constructs
  when no embedder installs one, so WebView is covered without any shell
  code of ours. So Developer options → "Animator duration scale: off" (the
  same scale Android's Accessibility → "Remove animations" zeroes) makes
  these jumps instant in the shipped build. The user's phone reported 1.0,
  i.e. smooth today; the setting was READ only, never changed.
- If it is ever made instant in code, the one thing to watch on the device is
  a jump
  measured before the opened section settles (the clamp described at
  index.html:3197) — the codebase's answer to that class of bug is
  `revealFirstMark`'s ResizeObserver settle loop.

## Appearance sheet: collapsible groups + the Screen rows (2026-09-21, this session)

Same branch (`Dictionary-Settings2`), uncommitted, on top of the dictionary-settings
window. The user asked for two things, then sent three rounds of corrections from phone
looks (the notes say which is which). The user builds, so this session built no APK — only
the routine checks, all listed at the end of this section.

- **All three groups have one shape, and the whole sheet is one scroll.** Each section is
  a wrapper holding a `.group-bar` and a body (`#appearanceBackground`, `#appearanceScreen`,
  `#stylerBody`); folding a bar hides its body, and every bar travels with what it folds.
  All three live inside `#appearanceGroups`, which is now the sheet's whole scrolling area
  (`flex:1 1 auto`), so the sections behave identically instead of two scrolling while the
  third was pinned below them. Order: `Screen`, `Window background`, `Custom CSS`. This is
  the third correction of the same area from phone looks (first the bar was pinned with its
  contents and read as a section that never moved; then it was pinned above them and the
  bar scrolled away from the contents it speaks for; now everything scrolls together, which
  is what "behaves like the two sections above" means). Open/closed is `appearanceOpen` and
  is never read back off the DOM, because `appearanceRender` re-runs on every bridge round
  trip. Folding Custom CSS also puts `no-css` on the sheet: `height:auto`, and the page's
  bottom padding follows the MEASURED sheet height (`--styler-shown`,
  `appearanceSheetHeight`), so a folded editor gives the screen back rather than leaving a
  full-height sheet with an empty lower half. The editor is now a fixed 16em box and the
  Files/Presets panes are plain blocks (their own scrollbars are gone — two scrollers
  fighting for one thumb on a phone).
- **The caret's box is brought back into view** (`stylerBoxIntoView`): on the transition
  into editing (`stylerEditing`) and whenever the scroller's height changes while the caret
  is in the box (`stylerFit` compares `clientHeight` — the keyboard shrinking the WebView is
  a height change, and a reader scrolling by hand is not). It scrolls the caret's box to
  just under the scroller's top edge, which is the one thing that must be on screen while
  typing.
- **Both colour fields gained a pipette** (`#appearanceColorPick`, `#edgeColorPick`) that
  opens the platform's own chooser through one hidden `<input type="color">`; which field
  the dialog fills is remembered while it is open (the ＋ tile's bargain for uploads), and
  the value is applied on `change`, never on every drag frame. The Screen group's `Colour`
  row is still shown ONLY for "a colour you pick" (`appearanceRender`: `edgeColorRow.hidden
  = edge !== EDGE_CUSTOM`).
- `go build ./...`, `git diff --check` and `:app:compileFossDebugJavaWithJavac` (from
  `android/`, `ANDROID_HOME` passed explicitly) all pass for the first pass. **The three
  correction rounds that followed are NOT browser- or build-verified** (the user asked for
  no build): the Screen/Window-background swap, the Custom CSS bar leaving the pinned spot,
  and now the one-scroller layout, the box-into-view and the pipette buttons. Static checks
  only for those: markup tag-balanced with the intended nesting (`#styler` = head +
  `#appearanceGroups` + note; the scroller holds the three group wrappers; each wrapper
  holds its bar and its body), app.css braces balanced, no JS reference to an id that no
  longer exists. No APK built, nothing installed.
- **The automatic collapse stayed, and is now overrulable.** The caret in the CSS box
  still stands `Window background` down and returns it on blur — the behaviour the user
  described from the phone — but it is EDGE-triggered (`stylerEditing`): a bar tap during
  editing clears the pending restore, so the 300ms poll cannot undo the reader's tap
  (verified: held for 670ms, more than two poll ticks).
- **The `Screen` group is the shell screen's two rows, moved.** `Edges of the screen`
  and `Hide while you read` became page-drawn dropdowns with the explanation under each
  (wording and option order taken verbatim from the strings the shell screen used), plus
  the margin-colour field, which is shown ONLY while the mode is "a colour you pick"
  (`appearanceRender`: `edgeColorRow.hidden = edge !== EDGE_CUSTOM`).
  `SettingsActivity` lost the whole section, `edgeRow`, `edgeColorDialog`, `choiceRow`
  and the strings; the bridge grew `edgeMode`/`edgeColor`/`bars` (validated both ways)
  and `MainActivity.refreshScreen()` applies them to the live window — the edge mode
  decides who wears the insets, so it re-asks for those as well. The floating lookup
  window only stores them; the app window picks them up on its next focus gain.
- **The dropdowns are the page's own menus, not `<select>`s** — the user's rule: the
  popup must wear the app's background and wallpaper, and the platform's own popup window
  cannot. They are `position:fixed` and placed from their anchor's rect (the sheet
  scrolls, and an absolute menu would be cut off at the scroller's edge), flip above the
  anchor when they would run off the bottom, follow it on scroll, and close on a tap
  outside. `.menu-card` is the shared shell-aware surface (the recipe `#styler` and the
  history dropdown already used), so they are windows like everything else.
- **The caret's box is kept in view, and the tab row with it** (`stylerBoxIntoView`): on the
  transition into editing (`stylerEditing`) and whenever the scroller's height changes while
  the caret is in the box (`stylerFit` compares `clientHeight` — the keyboard shrinking the
  WebView is a height change, a reader scrolling by hand is not). What it pins is the
  SECTION's top, not the box: the `Custom CSS` bar and the row of `App / Article / Files /
  Presets` tabs sit 8px under the scroller's top, because a row of tabs scrolled up under
  the sheet's head is a row of tabs nobody can press (the user's report). The box then takes
  the rest of the scroller and scrolls internally for its caret, as a textarea does. The
  `placed`/`fits` test is load-bearing: a section taller than the scroller can never satisfy
  "box bottom visible", and asking for the same scroll on every poll tick would jitter the
  sheet by the 8px gap for as long as the keyboard is up.
- **`hidden` is now authoritative inside the sheet** (`#styler [hidden]{display:none}` in
  app.css, replacing the per-id list). An AUTHOR rule such as `.appearance-row{display:flex}`
  outranks the user-agent's `[hidden]{display:none}` whatever the specificity, so an element
  the page hides by setting `.hidden` stays on screen: that is why the Screen group's colour
  row showed for EVERY mode (reported from the phone) — it is an `.appearance-row`, and the
  row was hidden by the property alone. The strip arrows already carried a guard of their own
  for the same reason (`.stripArrow[hidden]`, HANDOFF-worthy since the fourth appearance
  round). The whole area's elements are inside `#styler`, so one rule covers them; the check
  script that found this lists every element whose `hidden` the page toggles against the
  author `display` rules on that element itself (descendant rules are not the subject).
- **What the first browser pass MISSED, and why**: it asserted `!document.getElementById(id)
  .hidden` — the property — instead of the computed `display`, so an element that was
  "hidden" in every assertion was still painted on the phone. When a check is about what the
  reader sees, read `getComputedStyle(...).display` (or a rect), never the attribute.
- **The pipette IS the swatch, and it opens a window of the app** (`#colorDialog`,
  `dialog.group-dialog.panel-card` like the other windows): three R/G/B sliders with the
  channel's own gradient on the track, a live preview + hex, `Apply` and a ✕. The field's
  own recent-colours menu is unchanged; the window replaces the PLATFORM chooser
  (`<input type="color">`), because a picker reached from a field that already holds a
  colour has to open AT that colour and the platform's dialog is not ours to set — on the
  phone it came up at black while its own swatch showed the colour. `Apply` goes through
  `colorValueApply` (the same door a typed hex uses, so the shell applies and remembers it);
  the ✕ closes with nothing changed. `colorPickSync` paints the pipette with the colour it
  would open at, with the glyph flipped to dark on a light swatch; a field with no colour
  yet keeps the plain button. `stylerCloseSheet` closes the window with the sheet — a modal
  left standing over the page with nothing to apply it to is the bug that would otherwise
  follow.
  **The library question, answered with facts** (the user asked about
  jaredrummler/ColorPicker before this was written): it is real (`com.jaredrummler:
  colorpicker:1.1.0`, Maven Central, Apache-2.0, minSdk 14, published 2019-01, repo last
  pushed 2024-07) and one line in app/build.gradle would fetch it, but its POM depends on
  `androidx.appcompat:1.0.2` + `androidx.preference:1.0.0`, i.e. AppCompat and its
  transitive set inside an app whose build.gradle says outright that it has no dependencies;
  its dialogs are AppCompat widgets, which want an AppCompat theme our plain activities do
  not use. Against that, `tools/notices.sh` walks the GO module graph only, so a Gradle
  dependency would have to be written into the notices by hand (and into
  `tools/notices.head.md`, or the next `make notices` drops it). Three sliders in the page
  cost none of that, and the page already owns every other appearance surface.
- **A flexbox lesson from the middle of these rounds** (the rule itself is gone with the
  one-scroller layout, the lesson is not): `flex-shrink` is weighted by base size AND a
  later `flex:1 1 auto` shorthand wins over an earlier `flex-shrink` — so a rule that tries
  to make the work area give way has to be stated after the panes' own shorthands, or it
  silently does nothing. Measured then at 390×780: settings 88px with it wrong, 298px with
  it right.
- **Verification status.** `go build ./...`, `git diff --check` and
  `:app:compileFossDebugJavaWithJavac` (from `android/`, `ANDROID_HOME` passed explicitly)
  pass for the FIRST pass, which is also the last thing actually driven in a browser
  (throwaway server, temp config, one stub `.dsl`, the shell bridge stubbed in the page
  exactly as `Shell.windows().onJsPrompt` answers it, and the host's background hook called
  with `#f4ecd8` + `paper_01.jpg`): every bar toggles, the caret collapse and its override
  behave, both menus open at the anchor's width with the current choice ticked and flip
  above when there is no room below, picking a mode round-trips through the bridge
  (`edgeMode:3` → the colour row appears; `#204060` → remembered; `4` → the EDGE_NONE
  explanation), all three menus compute the paper tint AND the wallpaper URL, a collapsed
  group survives a later `appearanceRead()`, and 320×640 has no horizontal overflow. That
  browser session could not inject clicks (`click` times out, `cua.click` inert) and
  `screenshot` timed out, so interactions went through the real handlers and layout was read
  from rects and computed styles — nothing was LOOKED at. **The three correction rounds
  after it are static-checked only** (the user asked for no build): the Screen/Window
  background swap, the Custom CSS bar leaving the pinned spot, and the one-scroller layout
  with the box-into-view and the pipettes. Static checks: markup tag-balanced with the
  intended nesting (`#styler` = head + `#appearanceGroups` + note; the scroller holds the
  three group wrappers; each wrapper holds its bar and its body), app.css braces balanced,
  no JS reference to an id that no longer exists. No APK built, nothing installed; phone
  checks are listed in `docs/ANDROID-UI-HANDOFF.md`.

## Configuration and Lemmatization pages (2026-09-20, this session)

Same branch, after the settings window. The two pages the window's toolbar opens
were given the closer they lacked, and lost the two navigation buttons they had.

- **The ✕ that "closes the window" is `history.back()`, not a link to "/"**
  (checked first, on the user's question: neither page has any special handling
  — both carried a plain `<a href="/">`, and `Shell.openExternal` lets
  same-origin URLs load in the WebView, so there is no shell channel involved).
  A link to "/" loads the app from scratch AND leaves the page's own entry in
  the history, so the phone's back gesture walks straight back into the page
  that was just closed. Back consumes that entry. Verified: ✕ on /setup →
  "/" again, and the next back gesture lands on an earlier entry, never on
  /setup. A first run (the server serves /setup for "/", so `history.length`
  is 1) has nothing behind it and hides the ✕.
- `web/setup.css`: `.card` gained `position:relative` and a shared `button.x`
  rule — the closer both pages wear, in the card's top-right where the app's
  windows put theirs. `web/setup.html` and `web/lemmas.html`: the ✕ markup
  (`#closePage`) and its handler; removed "Back to dictionaries" (and the JS
  line that un-hid `#cancel`, plus the now-dead `#save~.btn` rule) and the
  "🔤 Lemmatization" link with its one-line footnote; on the lemmas page,
  "Back to dictionaries" and "Folders…".
- `web/lemmas.html` also gained setup.html's shell-background hook
  (`wudictShellBackground`, `data-shell-image`/`-custom`/`-tone` and the
  transparent-body rules): the Android host calls that hook on every
  `onPageFinished` (Shell.applyBackground), so the page was being told about the
  wallpaper and ignoring it. Both pages now tint identically over the shell
  background — verified by calling the hook with `#f4ecd8`, image on: same
  attributes (`custom`+`image`+`tone=light`), same `rgba(0,0,0,0)` body and
  `rgba(255,255,255,.14)` card on both, and the same light-tone palette.
- Not verified on a phone; the ✕ position/behaviour and the wallpaper on the
  lemmas page still want a device pass.

## Dictionary settings window (2026-09-20, this session)

Branch `Dictionary-settings`, cut from `dev` (`adb5507`, plus the HANDOFF
commit); nothing committed yet. The per-dictionary cards left the Dictionaries
panel for a window of their own — `Dictionary settings`, opened by a new
`Edit dictionary settings` button beside `Edit dictionary groups`, the same
pattern as the group editor (modal `dialog.group-dialog.panel-card`,
`showModal()`). A second pass, on the user's instruction, took the enable/
disable feature out entirely and moved the machine's four actions in with the
cards.

- `web/index.html`: `<dialog id="dictSettings">` sits right after `#panel` and
  owns `#panelList` plus a fixed `.facts.configbar` holding `#editFolders`,
  `#rescanBtn`, `#lemmaLink`, `#ftsAllBtn`/`#ftsAllBox` (moved out of the panel's
  folder drawer, which keeps the history controls, Browse A–Z…, Appearance…, the
  paths and About). New JS: `showDictSettings`, a `dictListTop` scroll listener
  on `#dictSettingsScroll` (a closed dialog's scroller loses its offset, and a
  hundred cards is a lot of place to lose), and `reissueIfCorpusMoved`, which
  took over the re-issue `hidePanel` used to do. ONE snapshot (`panelSnap`)
  serves both closers: the first of them to close searches once if the ORDER
  moved, the second finds the snapshot level and searches nothing.
- **No "disabled dictionary" any more** — both switches are gone from the UI and
  the client no longer honours the stored `off` flag (a dictionary switched off
  before would otherwise stay invisible with nothing left to switch it on).
  `savePrefs` omits `off`, so the server's omitempty field goes false and
  `state.json` converges; `prefs.Off` (warm-up skip only) is untouched. Deleted:
  `disabled`, `enabledOrderedIds`, `toggleDict`, `setAllEnabled`,
  `syncPanelHeader`, the card's `.en` input and its `change` listener; the
  empty-scope message now names an empty group or says "no dictionaries to
  search". CSS: `.allrow`, `.allrow label`, `.pd.off` removed.
- `web/group-editor.css`: `#dictSettings` height/overscroll plus `.configbar`
  and `#ftsAllBox` pinned (`flex:none`). The earlier `:not(.en)` exclusion on the
  checkbox rules was reverted — with the switches gone, no `.en` element lives
  inside a `.group-dialog` any more.
- **Overlays must survive a trip to another page** (reported from the phone three
  times: first the window came back broken behind the drawer, then — after a fix
  that closed everything on the way out — the reader landed on the word cards,
  and the same again on a build where the page was not restored at all).
  `Lemmatization…` / `Edit folders…` are ordinary navigations, and the page can
  come back in two shapes, which is why there are two mechanisms in index.html:
  - **restored document** (`pageshow` with `persisted`): the DOM comes back with
    the drawer still `.show` and the window still carrying `open`, but NOT the
    TOP LAYER a modal `<dialog>` lives in — so the window arrives non-modal and
    painted under the panel (half of it hidden on a phone, ✕ behind the drawer).
    The handler closes and re-shows it, which re-enters the layer.
  - **reloaded document** (what the phone actually does): no overlays at all, so
    `rememberOverlays` writes them to `sessionStorage.wudict_overlays` on
    `pagehide` and `reopenOverlays` puts them back on a `back_forward` load
    (navigation type; verified end-to-end in the desktop browser, where the
    debugger disables the page cache and the back navigation is therefore a real
    reload — the window came back open and modal over the drawer). The note is
    rewritten on every pagehide, so a window closed after the return cannot come
    back, and `reload`/`navigate` loads reopen nothing.
  - `dialog.group-dialog.panel-card` keeps `z-index:300`, so a window is on top
    even before either mechanism runs.
  An earlier attempt closed everything on `pagehide`; the user rejected it.
- **The dialog is a framed card, and the two pages were renamed** (the user's
  screenshots settled what three rounds of wording had muddled: the window that
  went edge to edge was the Dictionary settings DIALOG, and the reference is the
  frame the Edit Folders/Lemmatization pages draw). So the
  `@media (max-width:600px)` block in group-editor.css that made the dialogs
  full screen on phones is REVERTED — the dialog is the centred
  `min(560px,94vw) × min(650px,85dvh)` card with a 12px radius at every width
  (measured at 360×780: 322×650, 19px margins — the pages' cards have 1em, i.e.
  16px). The ☰ drawer went back to its side sheet the same day: for one round it
  had been turned into a card too, on a previous message whose window names the
  user then corrected ("это мой косяк") — a `sheet vs card` question that no one
  asked, and one `git checkout` away if it is wanted after all.
  `setup.html`: `<h1>` and `<title>` are "Edit Folders" (were "wuDict
  Configuration"/"wudict Setup"); `lemmas.html`: "Lemmatization" (was "wuDict
  Lemmatization"). No test asserted either string.
- **Around a window: the background, not the app** (the last visible difference
  the user named: beside the pages there is only the wallpaper, beside the
  window the app showed through the 40% backdrop). `group-editor.css`:
  `.group-dialog::backdrop` is `var(--paper-bg,var(--bg))` — the colour the
  host sends — and `html[data-shell-image] .group-dialog::backdrop` paints
  `var(--paper-bk-image)` stretched `100% 100%`, the recipe `#styler` and
  `.color-history` already use. Both vars come from `wudictShellBackground`, so
  the modal now sits on exactly what the pages sit on and nothing of the app
  shows beside it (verified with the hook called as the host calls it: backdrop
  `rgb(244,236,216)` plain, plus `url(...)` stretched with an image, and the
  drawer + results no longer visible around the card). The ☰ drawer keeps its
  own dimmed overlay — `#panel` is chrome, not one of the windows the user
  compared; say the word if it should wear the background too.
- **On a phone the window IS the pages' card** (three rounds of phone reports
  settled it: bands too big → flush to the edges and the title too far in →
  finally "look at Edit Folders": a 1em margin on every side and 1.618em of
  padding inside, which is exactly what `.card` inside a `body{padding:1em}`
  wears). `group-editor.css`, `@media (max-width:600px)`:
  `inset:calc(1em + var(--wd-inset-top,0px)) 1em calc(1em + var(--wd-inset-bottom,0px))`,
  `width/height:auto`, `max-width/max-height:none`, `padding:1.618em`, plus
  `#groupEditor,#dictSettings{height:auto}` to lift the desktop heights.
  Measured at 360×780 against `/setup`: both cards start at 16px, both titles at
  43px, card 328 wide — the window 328×748 (16px bands top and bottom), the page's
  card running off the bottom. Desktop keeps the centred 560×650 window
  (85px margins at 1100×820).
- **The box stretches via `inset`, never a viewport unit** — and that is
  load-bearing, not style. With `height:100dvh` the reopened window came back
  small and centred after a trip to Edit Folders (the user's screenshot): the
  Android WebView reported a dynamic viewport ~145px SHORTER than the window at
  that moment, and `margin:auto` then centred the short box in the full
  viewport, i.e. exactly the bands the same user had complained about an hour
  earlier. `height:auto` under a four-sided `inset` cannot do that.
- **The window's height follows the WebView, and the shell was shrinking it**
  (the last phone report: the first open is perfect, but after a trip to Edit
  Folders and back the window is small again, with bands above and below).
  The box is viewport-driven by design (`inset` + `auto` sizes, no viewport
  unit), so a smaller window means a smaller viewport — and `MainActivity`
  padded the root with `Math.max(bars.bottom, ime.bottom)` **whenever the IME
  reported a height, visible or not**. A callback with a stale keyboard frame
  (or an IME going away while a page loads) therefore shrank the whole page:
  ~145px lost, which is the size the phone's screenshot showed the window
  losing. Fixed by gating both places on `insets.isVisible(Type.ime())`:
  `imeUp ? ime.bottom : 0` for the padding and `toPage && !imeUp` for the
  published inset. Java compiles (`:app:compileFossDebugJavaWithJavac`).
  NOT verified on a device — this is the diagnosis to test first, and if the
  window still shrinks the next step is a debug build
  (`setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(BuildConfig.DEBUG)` is already there, so the
  debug APK can be inspected over CDP).
- **Diagnosed on the device, over CDP** (the user installed a debug build —
  `setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(BuildConfig.DEBUG)` is already in both
  activities — and invited a look; `adb forward tcp:9222
  localabstract:webview_devtools_remote_<pid>` plus a ~60-line WebSocket client
  written over `node:net` in the node REPL, since that kernel has no WebSocket
  global). Findings, all measured on the live page:
  - The failing flow does NOT fail on a build carrying the `inset`+`auto` CSS:
    window open (viewport 763, window 731 = 763 − 2×16, modal, over the drawer) →
    `Edit folders…` → the ✕ → back → the window is reopened at 731 with the same
    viewport. The release build on the phone at the time was the OLDER
    `100dvh` one (its `.so` carries `2.618em`/`100dvh`, not `padding:1.618em`),
    which is why the user still saw it.
  - `--wd-inset-*` are `0px` in the default inset mode (the shell pads its root
    and publishes zeroes; only EDGE_NONE hands them to the page), so the CSS
    calc is a no-op there — the window follows the WebView, period.
  - Returning with NO overlay open leaves Chromium's restored focus on `#q` and
    the keyboard up (viewport 431), which is correct-but-surprising rather than
    a bug; with the drawer+window open the modal's `showModal()` takes the focus,
    so the keyboard stays down and the window comes back full size.
  - The `insets.isVisible(Type.ime())` guard in MainActivity is therefore
    unproven belt-and-braces: nothing reproduced a stale IME inset. It is kept
    because padding for a keyboard nobody can see is wrong on its face.
- **"Clear browser cache" in the app's Settings** (the user's answer to the
  stale-assets question: they asked for the control by name, so the label is
  theirs). `SettingsActivity` grew a hint + button under the Advanced block;
  `Shell.clearWebCache(Context)` empties the WebView's resource cache (a
  throwaway WebView's `clearCache(true)` — per-APPLICATION despite being an
  instance method) and `Shell.EXTRA_RELOAD` makes the window that shows the page
  load it again (MainActivity.onNewIntent). It touches no dictionary file, no
  prepared index and no localStorage: the hint says so, which is why the tap is
  not confirmed.
  Verified: the strings are in the built APK (`aapt2 dump strings`), the Java
  compiles, and the reload half was driven live on the phone (`am start … --ez
  wudict.reload true` → the page's navigation type went `navigate` → `reload`).
  The cache-emptying half could NOT be tapped through adb: this MIUI phone
  refuses input injection (`SecurityException: … INJECT_EVENTS`), and the button
  is native UI, so it awaits the user's first tap.
  The button itself sits BELOW the Close button, on the user's instruction: the
  last thing on the screen, since it is a last resort and not one of the
  settings.
- **The ☰ drawer is now titled "Settings"** (the user's rename): `<h2>`, the
  panel's `aria-label`, and the button's `title`/`aria-label` — the button had
  `aria-label="Manage dictionaries"`, both now say Settings. Verified live on
  the phone over CDP (`#panel h2`, getAttribute on `#panelBtn`) and in a
  screenshot of the running app; `docs/DICTIONARY-GROUPS.md` ("☰ → Settings →
  Edit dictionary groups") and the picker-mode note in the UI handoff were
  updated with it, and the ☰ glyph survived the edit (checked — the first
  attempt at the button line dropped it).
- Verified in the desktop browser against a throwaway server (temp config, two
  stub `.dsl`s, port 6899): panel holds the two buttons and none of the four
  actions; window modal at 560×650, toolbar above the cards, zero checkboxes in
  it; card reorder persists and does not search while the window is open; after
  closing window + panel the query re-issued exactly once with the new order;
  scroll offset restored on reopen; Rescan redraws the cards; the bulk FTS box
  opens inside the window (list 540px → 410px); empty-group message correct;
  Remove…/About/group editor intact; 380×700 and 320×640 fit. `go build ./...`
  passes. No APK, nothing on a phone, dark and paper themes unchecked.
- **This machine's in-app browser does not fire `<dialog>`'s `close` event at
  all** (Electron 41 / Chrome 146: a bare probe dialog closed with `close()` is
  silent, trusted or not). The focus return and the re-issue that hang off that
  event therefore cannot be exercised there — verified instead with a synthetic
  `dispatchEvent(new Event("close"))` and end-to-end through `hidePanel`'s own
  closer. Real Chromium and the Android WebView fire it; the group editor has
  relied on the same event all along.

## GitHub-facing identity (2026-09-20, this session)

README.md reworked on `dev` (commit `80a8392`): H1 is now
"wuDict2 — an Android fork of WuWeiDict" with a what-differs block (app ID,
port 6889, Android UI work, license) at the very top; the mid-file
"wuDict2 for Android" section was folded into it. Repo settings changed via
the GitHub API (no `gh` CLI on this machine; token came from
`git credential fill`): default branch `master` → `dev` (so the landing page
shows the fork README), About description now names wuDict2, topics set
(android, dictionary, golang, mdx, stardict, slob, dsl, bgl, zim,
offline-dictionary). Homepage still points at the upstream docs site —
deliberately kept. `master` stays upstream-sync-only per AGENTS.md; it was
not touched.

Repository renamed `DmShAl/wudict` → `DmShAl/wudict2` on the user's request,
same session: same repo, all settings/issues/fork relation kept, GitHub
redirects the old slug permanently (until a new repo takes that name).
Local `origin` updated to the new URL. No CI, badge or script hardcodes the
old slug; the only in-repo mention (historical handoff note in
`docs/ANDROID-FORK.md`) is annotated. User preference, given twice
(release notes, then README): do NOT name the application ID
(`com.dmshepeta.wudict2`) in public-facing texts — "installs beside the
upstream wuDict app, default port 6889" is the approved wording.

## Release wudict2-v0.1.0 (2026-09-20, this session)

Tagged `wudict2-v0.1.0` (annotated, on dev `4b082e1`), pushed, then
`build-android.cmd release` rebuilt the APK so `git describe` supplied the
versionName (aapt2 confirms `versionName='wudict2-v0.1.0'`, versionCode 291,
package `com.dmshepeta.wudict2`; apksigner: V2, CN=Dmitry Shepeta). Release
created via API and the signed APK uploaded as
`wudict2-android-arm64-foss.apk` (7,241,264 bytes; download URL verified
200 with matching length):
https://github.com/DmShAl/wudict2/releases/tag/wudict2-v0.1.0
Fork-tag convention going forward: prefix release tags with `wudict2-…` so
upstream's `vX.Y.Z` tags never clash when syncing `master`.

Windows gotcha: in a background `cmd //c` from this shell,
`LOCALAPPDATA` may be undefined, so build-android.cmd's default SDK path
stays the literal `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk` and fails. Fix: pass
`set ANDROID_HOME=C:\Users\shepe\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk&&` in front of
the script call (no space before `&&`).

CHANGELOG.md added on `dev` (2026-09-20): one `wudict2-…` section per
release, newest first, relative to the upstream fork point (v0.1.0's
baseline: upstream `223b990`, between v3.7.4 and v3.7.5-alpha.1). Update
it with every future release; the release body mirrors the same text
under `## Changes`.

## Release wudict2-v0.2.0 (2026-09-26, this session)

The second tagged build and the first cut through the changelog workflow.
The ORDER matters and was followed: the CHANGELOG.md section was committed on
`dev` (`771d258`), `dev` pushed, the annotated tag `wudict2-v0.2.0` put on
that commit and pushed, and only THEN `build-android.cmd release`. The build
has to come after the tag, because versionName is `git describe` at build
time; aapt2 confirms `versionName='wudict2-v0.2.0'`, versionCode 371 (dev's
commit count), `lib/arm64-v8a/libwudict.so` the only native lib.

**Upgrade compatibility with v0.1.0 was verified, not assumed.** The v0.1.0
APK was downloaded from its release and compared: apksigner reports the same
V2 signer certificate SHA-256
(`b7ddc95dea6c1663edc79370301bc10ec2255085da07aeb3c3e4e491abeb2520`,
CN=Dmitry Shepeta) for both, and 371 > 291, so an installed v0.1.0 updates in
place instead of needing an uninstall. The asset now on the release was
downloaded back and hashed against the local build — identical, 7,482,501
bytes,
sha256 `a5788eea6c102e8cd923177bb35c4c03fcdc5d1842fdc2cf3b6bd3f94126c45e`.
The published body is byte-identical to CHANGELOG.md's v0.2.0 section.
https://github.com/DmShAl/wudict2/releases/tag/wudict2-v0.2.0

Tooling facts that cost time here and will again:

- **`/tmp` in this shell is `D:\Temp\User`, but Windows `python3` resolves a
  leading `/` against the CURRENT DRIVE** — `/tmp/x` in a python argv means
  `D:\tmp\x`, which does not exist. Pass `$(cygpath -w /tmp/x)`.
- **Do not build the release JSON with PowerShell 5.1.** `[ordered]@{}` +
  `ConvertTo-Json` mangled the body into a nested object and produced a 3.8 MB
  payload from a 6 KB one. `python3` (3.14 is on PATH) with
  `json.dumps(..., ensure_ascii=False)` written as UTF-8 without a BOM works.
- `gh` is still not installed; `git credential fill` still supplies the token
  (username `DmShAl`), so releases go through the REST API. `apksigner.bat`
  and `aapt2.exe` live in `$LOCALAPPDATA/Android/Sdk/build-tools/37.0.0`.
- The `Build Android APK` workflow has never run (`actions/runs` is empty) and
  no repo Actions secrets are configured, so CI cannot publish a release: the
  local `build-android.cmd release` with the untracked
  `build-android.local.bat` keystore is the path that produces the asset.

The notes deliberately do not name the application ID — the standing user
preference recorded in the identity section above.

## Release wudict2-v0.3.0 (2026-09-27, this session)

Third tagged build, same order as v0.2.0 and confirmed again: the changelog
commit on `dev` (`fad2d12`), `dev` pushed, the annotated tag `wudict2-v0.3.0`
on that commit and pushed, and only THEN `build-android.cmd release` — the
build has to come after the tag, because versionName is `git describe` at build
time. aapt2: `versionName='wudict2-v0.3.0'`, versionCode 376 (dev's commit
count), arm64 only. The cycle carried two UI commits (`5dc4d99`, `a808a64`)
and no upstream sync — `master` had not moved since `5f0ad02`.

Verified the same way: the published asset was downloaded back and hashed
against the local build (identical, 7,488,237 bytes,
sha256 `28e2027b89cf1e2d81ca114eb5ccca22939a68e586fd21d5104e13963887412e`), the
signer certificate is the one v0.1.0 and v0.2.0 already carry
(`b7ddc95d…`, CN=Dmitry Shepeta) with 376 > 371 > 291, so an installed v0.1.0
or v0.2.0 updates in place, and the published body is byte-identical to
CHANGELOG.md's v0.3.0 section.
https://github.com/DmShAl/wudict2/releases/tag/wudict2-v0.3.0

One operational fact worth knowing: creating a release and uploading its asset
are two API calls, so the release is PUBLIC and asset-less for the ~30 s
between them — both times so far, invisible only because nobody was looking. If
that ever matters, create it with `draft: true` and flip it after the upload.

The tooling traps listed in the v0.2.0 section above still stand and were partly
hit again (python3 resolving a leading `/tmp` against the CURRENT drive). No
`gh`; the token still comes from `git credential fill`; build the release JSON
with `python3`, never PowerShell 5.1.

## Release wudict2-v0.4.0 (2026-09-27, this session)

Fourth tagged build, same order again: the changelog commit (`bd17906`), `dev`
pushed, the tag `wudict2-v0.4.0` on it, pushed, then `build-android.cmd
release`, then the REST create and the asset upload. aapt2:
`versionName='wudict2-v0.4.0'`, versionCode 379, arm64 only. One content commit
this cycle (`155e30d`, the Status bar) and again no upstream sync — `master`
still at `5f0ad02`.

Verified as before: the published asset was downloaded back and hashed against
the local build (identical, 7,493,181 bytes,
sha256 `961b8fc68bc46da6cfcb76b1215fb387e447677d1a46b0ac6ce825ae4fc11fe8`); the
signer certificate is still the one every tag carries (`b7ddc95d…`, CN=Dmitry
Shepeta) with 379 > 376, so v0.3.0 updates in place; the published body is
byte-identical to CHANGELOG.md's v0.4.0 section.
https://github.com/DmShAl/wudict2/releases/tag/wudict2-v0.4.0

Nothing new was learned about the tooling — the same commands, and the
create-then-upload window noted under v0.3.0 above still applies. The cycle is
routine now, and the one thing that needs deciding each time is the version
number. The convention actually followed so far: **fork-visible features get a
minor bump** (`0.1 → 0.2 → 0.3 → 0.4`), including a release that only removed a
control; a patch bump has not been used yet and would fit a fix-only cycle.

## Release wudict2-v0.5.0 (2026-09-28, this session)

Fifth tagged build, the same order yet again and now routine: the changelog
commit (`577c586`), `dev` pushed, the tag `wudict2-v0.5.0` on it, pushed, then
`build-android.cmd release`, then the REST create and the asset upload. aapt2:
`versionName='wudict2-v0.5.0'`, versionCode 385, arm64 only. Four content
commits this cycle (`bef262d`, `7eb0e40`, `7be896e`, `3bfe24d`) and again no
upstream sync.

Verified as before: the published asset was downloaded back and hashed against
the local build (identical, 7,507,009 bytes,
sha256 `9e2772d64a7b618f024e348e61c599fad23172b8a6d36f0e740973f07f40e0d7`); the
signer certificate is still the one every tag carries (`b7ddc95d…`, CN=Dmitry
Shepeta) with 385 > 379, so v0.4.0 updates in place; the published body is
byte-identical to CHANGELOG.md's v0.5.0 section.
https://github.com/DmShAl/wudict2/releases/tag/wudict2-v0.5.0

Two departures from the four before it, both worth knowing:

- **The tree arrived dirty, with the reader's work STAGED but uncommitted**
  (the drawn checkboxes, five files). It was left untouched and the reader
  committed it as `3bfe24d` before the release was cut — which is the right
  resolution, and the reason matters: `build-android.cmd` embeds the web assets
  it finds in the WORKING TREE, so a build over uncommitted work ships that work
  while the tag points at a commit that does not contain it. Check `git status`
  before tagging, not after.
- **The release body carries a "Known issue" for the first time**: a preset's
  night half never reaches the page (True black and Warm dark attach and change
  nothing). A defect found while doing this cycle's paper work rather than one
  this release introduced, and recorded in HANDOFF.md's "what remains" too.
  Notes that hide a defect the reader will hit are worse than notes that name it.

**REPLACED the same day** (2026-09-28), at the reader's request — "не добавлять
новый релиз, а заменить последний", nobody but this session's own verification
having fetched the asset. The night-preset fix (`6d7dc6a`: `:root` →
`html[data-dark]` in the two night halves, guarded by
`TestPresetAppHalvesOutrankTheirPalette`) was folded INTO v0.5.0: the changelog
gained a "True black and Warm dark take effect at night" subsection, the body
dropped its "Known issue" paragraph, the tag was moved to the new commit, and the
APK was rebuilt (versionCode 385 → 389, sha256
`1e8f0de9f13b03ec48d8f4b13fd45c9062989deafbcb74395b0113963a40ff5f`) and swapped
in.

**The trap that cost a detour, and will again: deleting a release's tag makes
GitHub convert that release into a DRAFT.** It happened on the tag deletion
alone, before anything was pushed — the next API call returned the release as
`draft: true` with `tag_name` rewritten to `untagged-<sha>`, i.e. gone from the
public releases page — and PATCHing the body alone does not undo it. Recovery, in
this order: push the tag again, then `PATCH /releases/<id>` with
`{"tag_name": "<tag>", "name": "...", "draft": false}`, then check `html_url` and
`draft`. So a re-release is: PATCH the body and swap the asset FREELY (both are
safe in place), and move the tag ONLY if the APK itself has to change — the tag
move is the one step that costs the draft round-trip.

Also about the asset swap: it is DELETE the old asset, then POST the new one under
the same name, and the fresh asset starts a new `download_count` — so a "0
downloads" right after says nothing about whether the old one was fetched.
(v0.5.0's pre-fix asset read 2, and both were this session's own verification
fetches: the hash check and the final status check.)

## The third session: five changes in the panel, the bar and the paper (2026-09-27/28)

**The third session's five changes (2026-09-27/28; committed `bef262d`,
`7eb0e40`, `7be896e`, `3bfe24d`; shipped in v0.5.0): the `Show info messages`
row, the page's top edge, the panel/status-bar moves, the notes' ink, and the
preset's paper.** One thing to know about `bef262d`: its message landed as a
single 2785-character subject line — the intended subject is `feat(ui): the
notes switch, the flush header, and the scope chip`, and git-cliff reads only
the first line.

1. The switch that turns the app's transient notes off — MainActivity's
   "Starting wuDict2…", the page's waiting art and its "N of M ready" counter,
   and the lookup popup's "Looking up …". A plain `ShellPrefs` boolean
   (`INFO_MESSAGES`, ON by default), read by three Activities and delivered to
   the page on the URL beside `shell_bg` (`shell_quiet=0|1`); the page's half
   is in `index.html`'s head block and its boot/status guards. **The morph note
   is NOT silenced** — the switch covered it at first and the reader asked for
   it back ("this message must stay"): it says the answers are for a different
   form of the word, which is read rather than skimmed. **A phone has to
   confirm the row, the empty first frame and the popup without its line.**
   Full statement, reasons
   and measurements: `docs/ANDROID-UI-HANDOFF.md` → "Decisions to preserve" →
   "The information messages are one switch".
2. The page's top edge: `body{padding-top:var(--barh)}` — one rule at every
   width, replacing a fixed `4.236em` above 600px and a `--barh + --sp-2` copy
   below it — plus `#out>:first-child>details.dict{margin-top:0}`, which gives
   the first section up its `--sp-2` so its header is flush against the bar.
   Between them they remove the empty band between the search bar and the first
   dictionary header (34px at 1100px, 20px on a phone) and fix 601–800px, where
   the fixed value was 11px too small for a two-row bar and the first card
   began above the bar's lower edge. The header is now in the same place in
   every state — at the bar's edge while the bar is visible, at the window's
   top edge once it auto-hides. `details.dict>summary` no longer transitions
   `top`: the bar's box changes size in a single frame (the shell re-publishes
   the top inset on every frame of a system-bar swipe, and a two-row wrap or a
   growing `<select>` does the same), and a .28s offset arrived after the edge
   it aimed at — which is the header that was seen tucked under the bar while
   scrolling up. Same doc, bullet "The first section's header is flush against
   the bar, in every state".
3. Three UI moves of the reader's: the "Open first" pair is out of the panel
   (the wiring removed, the machinery — `orderFirst`, `applyOpenOrder`,
   `fastFirst`, the server's `UIPrefs.FastFirst` — deliberately left in place
   for upstream merges, and the stored value is no longer read); the dictionary
   chip moved WHOLE from the search field to the status bar, between the arrows
   and Examples (chip + its real `<select>`, so the shell's picker wiring is
   untouched) — and it TRAVELS: back into the field whenever that bar is hidden,
   which is the empty start and any time the bar is switched off, with "All" in
   the field and the group's own name in the bar; and its place in the panel's
   Results section is taken by a labelled drop-down of the reader's groups
   (label "Dictionaries", in the reading strip's own 96px column), whose choice
   goes through the same `wudictPickerGroupChanged` the native window's spinner
   calls. The chip itself now names the group in force instead of saying "All"
   (which is what removed the old `SCOPE_SHORT` map), and the read is guarded
   because `syncChips` runs before `group-editor.js` declares `userGroups` — an
   unguarded read there kills the rest of the page script (seen on the
   emulator). **Verified on the x86_64 emulator** (`build-android.cmd debug
   intel`, installed over the debug package that was already there): the panel
   drop-down and its label, the group list, the re-run it triggers, the chip
   reading "Test" then "All Dictionaries" in the bar, and the chip sitting in
   the field on the empty start. The row's own spacing came from the reader's
   phone afterwards (third round): the two ends are 10px gutters instead of
   full squares, the chip has a floor of one square of air on EACH side
   (`.rpad.floor` carrying the auto margins, so the two gaps are equal and
   neither can collapse — the phone had the chip pressed against ▼), and the
   fold's handle shortens to "Ex" below 420px, the width at which the full word
   stops fitting beside "All Dictionaries". Same doc, bullet "Open first is
   gone, the dictionary chip lives in the status bar…".
4. The notes' ink: `.scopenote` (the scope, widen and morph notes) is
   `--fg-soft` now, not `--fg-faint` — the reader's "these messages are too
   pale", and `--fg-faint` is 2.9:1 against the light paper.
5. **The preset's paper reaches the windows the app page does not paint**
   (2026-09-28, from the reader: in Warm the Folders/Lemmatization/Browse
   pages were white while `Edit dictionary groups` was warm). A preset layer
   reaches one document, so the colour now travels to the host: manifest →
   `/api/presets` (resolved per theme) → the appearance bridge → `ShellPrefs`
   (`preset_paper`) → `pageBg`, plus a new `shell_paper` parameter and the
   hook's fourth argument for the three pages. **The app page only FORWARDS
   it** (`shell_bg` stays the reader's colour), and the wallpaper is
   untouched. With it: the two pages' checkboxes are DRAWN now (the app's own
   square — they were platform widgets that ignored the paper entirely), and
   the four page rules that kept a platform box's `width:auto` had to drop it.
   Verified in Chromium on a throwaway server plus `go test`, `go vet`, the
   Java compile — and **confirmed on the reader's phone the same day**: the
   release build of 2026-09-28 11:49 was cut from exactly this state of the
   tree (the paper, the two pages' checkboxes and the night-preset fix below
   are all in it) and the reader's answer was "Работает". Statement, the naming
   of every window (report them by these names) and a night-preset defect found
   on the way — **fixed and phone-confirmed the same day** by moving the two
   night app halves to `html[data-dark]`, now guarded by
   `TestPresetAppHalvesOutrankTheirPalette`:
   `docs/ANDROID-UI-HANDOFF.md`.

## Appearance implementation (2026-09-20)

Uncommitted on `fix/review-hardening`. The former native Settings controls for
Background color and Background Image now live above App/Article/Files in the
web Appearance sheet. `wudict:appearance` reads/writes the *same* `ShellPrefs`
keys, and the native shell still paints both windows before HTML loads. The
image picker reads `WindowBackground.images` from the same Files store;
browser-only use hides these native controls.

Same-day rework after user review, still uncommitted. The sheet gained a real
head row (`#stylerHead`: "Appearance" + the ✕, top-right in both the native and
browser layouts — the ✕ used to sit in the mid-sheet toolbar row). The
Background Image dropdown + Add… pair is gone: `appearanceRender` now builds a
thumbnail strip (`#appearanceStrip`) — a None tile, one tile per image
(`/files/<name>`, `object-fit:cover`, lazy), a dashed tile for a selected-but-
missing name (tapping it clears the stale pref), and a ＋ tile that opens the
system file chooser synchronously (user activation is never spent on a pane
switch) and, via `stylerPickForBackground`, promotes the last uploaded image to
the background; the input's `cancel` event clears the flag. The Files tab stays
the manager for CSS-referenced files; deleting a chosen background image from
there still resets the pref (via `appearanceState`). The custom-CSS textarea
now uses the app typeface at 13px like the Background rows (was monospace
12.5px), and both section headings share one weight.

Verified in a desktop browser against a throwaway server (temp config, one
minimal .dsl, two uploaded PNGs): sheet opens from the panel, Background hidden
without the shell, strip renders with the right selection ring, thumbnail/None/
missing taps round-trip the bridge state, ✕ and Escape close, Files tab intact.
Java compilation, `go build ./...` clean. No APK was built, installed, or
tested on a phone. On device still to check: strip layout with real wallpaper
sizes and large system fonts, immediate repaint of both windows after a tile
tap, cold-start background without white flash.

Second user-review round, same day, NOT build- or browser-verified (user asked
for neither; they will check on the phone). Section headings are separated by
hairlines (under `#stylerHead` and under the window-background block), and the
Background heading is now "Window background" — the android:windowBackground
term, not "Windows background". The ＋ tile is smaller than a thumbnail and
dashed; its box is sized off an absolute 12px base because em sizes on it
would resolve against the inherited 16px sheet font and grow it right back.
Scroll affordance: `appearanceStripHints` toggles `fade-l`/`fade-r` mask
gradients on the strip by scroll position (scroll + resize listeners; renders
re-run it). `BUILTIN_BACKGROUNDS` (paper_01.jpg, paper_02.jpg) render no
Delete button in Files and carry a "built in, restored at startup" note — the
shell recopies them when absent, so Delete could only promise what it cannot
do; `stylerFileDelete` also refuses them. The Files tab keeps its Add…: the
store holds fonts and stylesheets the strip never offers, and in a desktop
browser the Background section does not exist at all, so Add… is the only
upload door there.

Third user-review round, same day, NOT build- or browser-verified (user asked
for neither; they will check on the phone). The Background-color checkbox now
wears the groups editor's square (20px, --fg border, drawn check, --paper-bg
under it) instead of the platform box. The strip's edge fades are gone:
`#appearanceStripWrap` carries two carousel chevrons (`#appearanceStripL/R`),
shown exactly while that side still hides thumbnails (appearanceStripHints
toggles `hidden`; scroll + resize listeners; renders re-run it), and a tap
scrolls ~80% of the view smoothly. Note `.stripArrow[hidden]{display:none}` is
load-bearing — the class's display:flex outvotes the UA hidden rule otherwise.
The ＋ tile is back to the thumbnails' exact 4.1em box (dashed border is the
only distinction); its glyph is a span at 1.9em because bare text would
inherit the 12px basis and look lost. Shell.java's WebChromeClient now answers
`onJsConfirm` and `onJsAlert` on the shared `BackgroundDialogBuilder` surface
(so the Files list's "Delete X?" sits on the same wallpaper and palette as the
pickers; every exit answers the JsResult once, a bad window token cancels).

Fourth user-review round, same day, NOT build- or browser-verified (user asked
for neither; they will check on the phone). The thumbnails now dissolve BEFORE
the arrows instead of under them: `fade-l`/`fade-r` masks are back (one
gradient per combination — stacked mask layers composite source-over and a
second layer would un-fade the first edge), tuned to reach full transparency
at 2.8em from the edge, which is exactly where the 2.5em+.3em arrow circle
ends; both fade and arrow ride on the same condition in appearanceStripHints.
Mask lengths resolve against the strip's inherited 16px — the same base the
arrow is drawn against. The chevrons were redrawn (1.8 stroke, 1.25em box).
The color field gained a recent-colors dropdown: the last ten accepted colors
in localStorage (`wudict_color_history`, web-side convenience — the shell
still owns the applied color), swatch rows in `#appearanceColorMenu`, opening
on focus/pointerdown, Escape stops at the menu, outside tap closes; only
colors the shell accepted are remembered. The dropdown wears the search-history
surface verbatim (bg-card, or paper tint + wallpaper under `data-shell-*`).
The 35% row cap on the color input moved to `#appearanceColorBox` (a
percentage on the input would now resolve against the box and cap nothing).

Open question answered, not implemented: deriving a matching background color
from the chosen image (average of a downscaled copy, or a dominant-bucket
histogram for textures like the paper wallpapers) — feasible both web-side
(canvas on /files/<name>, same-origin) and in WindowBackground, which already
holds a downsampled bitmap. Waiting for the user to pick a shape (a "from
image" affordance vs auto-suggest on selection) before building it.

Fifth user-review round, same day, NOT build- or browser-verified (user asked
for neither; they will check on the phone). The auto-suggest question was
settled: choosing a background image - a thumbnail tap or the ＋-tile upload -
now also computes the image's dominant color and fills, applies and remembers
it in the color field (`appearanceImageChosen` → `appearanceDominantColor`:
24×24 canvas sample, 4-bit-per-channel histogram, largest bucket averaged,
transparent pixels skipped; a sequence guard orders rapid taps; the on/off
checkbox is left alone; any failure yields "no suggestion"). The arithmetic
is instant; only the decode costs, and the browser has usually done it for
the thumbnail. The row labels shrank to "Color" / "Image" and the label
column to 4.2em, so the strip gains the width. The arrows are bare chevrons
now (no circle) with a hand-computed ~150° tip — apex (13,8), tips at
±75° from the axis, path M11.4 2 L13 8 l-1.6 6 and its mirror — colored
var(--fg) with a drop-shadow halo in var(--bg), hover/focus accent; the
mask's transparent stop moved to 2.9em to match the new 2.6em+.3em hit area.

Sixth user-review round, same day, NOT build- or browser-verified (user asked
for neither; they will check on the phone). The toolbar row now shares one
chrome — `#styler .tab`, `#styler .btn` and `#stylerPreset` in one rule
(12.5px, same padding/height/palette/radius); the preset `<select>` gets
`appearance:none` because on Android the platform select face was the loudest
of the mismatches; the narrow media query shrinks all three to 11.5px
together. Files-pane mini-buttons keep their compact 12px (later rule, same
specificity). The strip's fade mask was tightened to end at 2.3em from the
edge — just before the drawn chevron's outer tips (2.35em), not before the
2.9em hit box — so a thumbnail stays visible until it is a whisker from the
arrow and fades only across its last 1.4em. Same-day tweak to that tweak:
the fade was still ending at the hit box's boundary, so the mask now runs to
1.8em — a whisker short of the box's center (1.6em, where the chevron's apex
sits) — and the picture holds until it is essentially under the arrow.

## Presets as toggleable layers (2026-09-20, evening)

Uncommitted, on top of the appearance rounds. First shipped BROKEN — the user
reported "articles gone, top-bar buttons dead" — then debugged live on a
throwaway local server (built the binary, ran it, drove the page in the
browser; the standing "don't build/run" rule was suspended for that
diagnosis). Two real bugs were found and fixed, and the whole feature is now
verified end-to-end in the browser against a temp config and a one-entry
.dsl:

- **TDZ crash killed the whole page.** `frameCSS()` reads
  `presetArticleCSS`, but the variable was declared in the styler let-chain
  ~2800 lines below the line where `applyTheme()` runs and calls
  `pushFrameCSS()` → `frameCSS()`. Every handler after that point never
  bound — hence no articles, dead buttons. Fix: `presetArticleCSS` is
  declared beside the article plumbing (`let userArticleCSS`), where the
  comment explains WHY the placement is load-bearing.
- **`ContainsAny(name, "..\\")` 404'd every preset file.** The dot in
  "file.css" is a member of that rune set, so
  `GET /assets/presets/<g>/<f>` 404'd everything while the injected links
  looked fine. Fix: two `strings.Contains` checks (".." and `\`) plus the
  existing `//` check. Verified: files 200, manifest.json and traversal 404.

Also fixed along the way: the two `s.pageFor("")` call sites in
assets_test.go (signature grew a second parameter); go vet passes for the
whole module. E2E verified: search renders articles; presets pane renders
17 rows in 13 groups with radio groups marked "pick one"; Background hidden
without a shell image; Sepia on → its link injected before the user's, its
article half composed under the user text, state written to
style/presets.json; True black switches Sepia off (radio); reload → server
injects the enabled preset's link and the stylesheet parses (`sheet !==
null`); Insert-as-text lands both halves with the view following; toggling
off cleans links and the state file.

The Examples menu is gone. Presets were text pasted into the user's two
stylesheets, and un-applying one meant hand-deleting lines out of two boxes.
Now each preset is a file pair under `internal/server/web/presets/<group>/`
and a LAYER the page attaches and detaches around the user's own CSS; the
editor's App/Article boxes hold only what the user owns.

- Layout on disk IS the conflict model (the user's design): each
  subdirectory is a group of presets that exclude each other —
  `background/` holds Background image, Sepia, True black, Warm dark
  (one or none), `fonts/` holds the font choices Serif, Condensed, Light
  (one or none — a face is picked, not stacked); every other preset got a
  directory of its own and behaves as a free toggle. `manifest.json` in the
  same folder carries order, titles, descriptions and each preset's
  app/article file names.
- Server (`internal/server/presets.go`): embedded registry parsed once;
  `GET /api/presets` (full list with inline contents + enabled set),
  `PUT /api/presets` ({id,on}; radio enforced per group), state in
  `<StyleDir>/presets.json` (temp+rename), and `GET /assets/presets/<g>/<f>`
  serving the app halves immutably (content-hashed URLs; `manifest.json`
  itself answers 404; backslash/.. rejected — the FS is forward-slash even
  on Windows). Routes registered in routes.go; `/api/presets` documented in
  openapi.yaml (Spec field set, so TestOpenAPICoversEveryRoute stays honest).
- Page injection: `pageFor(tag, presetLinks)` — the preset `<link
  data-preset>`s are spliced at `{{USERCSS}}` BEFORE the user's link, so the
  user wins every tie; the page cache key is both parts, and `?style=off`
  omits presets with everything else.
- Client: fourth tab "Presets" in the sheet (pane reuses the Files pane's
  look; switches are the panel's `.en`). `presetApplyAll()` syncs app links
  + `presetArticleCSS`, and `articleRefresh()` is now the one place the
  article sheet is built (presets under user text); `frameCSS()` composes
  the same way. `stylerInsertPreset` = the old apply-as-text (Files→Insert
  uses it too; handles both payload and legacy shapes), `presetRemovePasted`
  + exact-text detection migrate old pastes (commit BEFORE mutate — a
  textarea still holding old text would reinstall the block via
  stylerShowTab's commit). `?style=off` blocks the whole preset path.
- Startup: `presetsLoad()` is called fire-and-forget from group-editor.js's
  boot line — which is ALSO where the boot chain lives now; `loadUserCSS`
  had been left uncalled there since the "Search history" commit dropped the
  old `Promise.all` line (pre-existing bug: user article CSS never applied
  until the sheet was opened — fixed by wiring presetsLoad alongside it).
- Removed: STYLER_PRESETS, ART_THROUGH, stylerFillPresets, stylerApplyPreset,
  the `stylerPreset` select (and its dead CSS), the four server embeds and
  the `{{BACKGROUND_PRESET}}/{{SEPIA_PRESET}}` substitutions. Shell.java's
  picker list still names `stylerPreset` but null-guards it — no Java change.

Verified in the desktop browser as listed above; NOT verified on a phone.
On-device checks: preset toggling feels instant on a real dictionary set,
radio switching in background/, cold-start injection order with several
presets enabled, migration of old pastes, `?style=off` interplay, and the
fonts group (Condensed/Light) against the system font-size setting.

Two user-review changes on top (same evening, verified in the desktop
browser only): the sheet now OPENS on the Presets tab (stylerOpen ends with
stylerShowPresets, not stylerShowTab — the switches are the entry point, and
no textarea focus means no keyboard popping over the pane), and the
keyboard-fit handler `stylerFit` + `#styler{bottom:var(--styler-bottom,0)}`
exist because a soft keyboard shrinks the layout viewport, `vh` with it, and
the fixed-height sheet squeezed the editor to one line. First attempt
relied on visualViewport resize/scroll events — on the phone the keyboard
overlap happened anyway (the events do not reliably fire for a keyboard in
every WebView mode), so while the sheet is open the fit now runs on a 300ms
POLL (`stylerFitStart`/`stylerFitStop` around open/close): covered window =
innerHeight − vv.height − vv.offsetTop; when covered, `--styler-h` is ~62%
of the VISIBLE height (floored at 240px) and `--styler-bottom` lifts the
sheet above the keyboard; keyboard down → overrides clear. `#stylerCSS`
has `min-height:5em` as the belt — at the 240px floor the editor keeps
~94px. The sheet also wears the shell background like the other windows:
`html[data-shell-sepia/image] #styler` applies the paper tint + wallpaper
recipe from history.css; solid `--bg` is the no-shell answer.

Follow-up from the phone run: the panel DID lift, but the fixed rows above
the editor (head, Background block with the strip) had grown so much since
the pre-thumbnail sheet that the lifted height left the editor one line.
The first `.editing` trigger (covered window AND caret in the textarea)
never fired on the phone, and the reason matters: **on the phone the
fork's inset padding shrinks the WebView together with the keyboard, so
`window.innerHeight` and `visualViewport.height` stay in step and the
overlap difference is ALWAYS ~0 there.** "The panel rises" on the phone is
the fork's own inset mechanism, not the page. The trigger is now the CARET
IN THE TEXTAREA alone (`stylerFit` toggles `#styler.editing` from the poll
and from focus/blur on the box; `#styler.editing` stands the Background
block and the note down). Measured: the block is 147px on a desktop
viewport; collapsing it took the editor from 219px to 409px. The color
input lives INSIDE the hidden block, but the trigger being the textarea's
caret means typing a hex keeps the block — the caret is elsewhere. The
overlap-based LIFT stays in stylerFit for window modes where the keyboard
draws over the page instead of shrinking it.

## Merged `Night-Day` into `dev2` (2026-09-25, this session)

The user merged the appearance branch into their integration branch and hit a
conflict; the resolution is recorded here because two of the three things that
had to be fixed were NOT the conflict itself.

- **`internal/server/web/index.html`, two hunks, one shape**: `dev2` had added
  `speakOff`/`applySpeak` to `loadPrefs`/`savePrefs`, `Night-Day` had added
  `fontWeight`/`applyFW` to the same two lines. Both sides are independent
  additions, so the resolution keeps BOTH — `applyFS, applyFW, applyHL,
  applySpeak, applyOpenOrder, applySortOrder` on load and
  `fontSize, fontWeight, hlOff, speakOff, fastFirst, sortMine` on save.
- **`LookupActivity.java` did not compile, and the merge did not do it**:
  `dev2` already carried `onPageFinished` TWICE in the same anonymous
  `WebViewClient` (one calling `Shell.applyBackground`, one calling
  `speech.inject`) — `javac: method onPageFinished(WebView,String) is already
  defined`. `Night-Day` and the merge base each had it once. Fixed by merging
  the two bodies into one method in `MainActivity`'s order
  (`applyBackground` then `speech.inject`). Verified with
  `:app:compileFossDebugJavaWithJavac`.
- **What the merge did NOT lose**, though a grep says it might: `dev2`'s
  `.themeBtn` and `#tabPresets` are gone from the merged file, because
  `Night-Day` deliberately replaced the cycling theme button with the
  two-button `.themeSwitch` and the sheet's tab row with the head's subject
  menu. `themeSwitch`/`themeAuto`/`themeFlip` are present, and the control
  reads `Auto ☀` on the device.
- **Verified after the merge**: `go build`, `go vet`, the server suite (only
  the two known Windows failures), the Java compile, a full
  `build-android.cmd debug intel`, and on the emulator — the page loads with
  no console errors, `#fsVal` 18px and `#fwVal` Medium (the weight stepper
  round-trips Medium → Bold → Medium), the speak button exists, all four
  `data-styler` doors open the sheet, and the Presets pane renders its 18
  switches. Note for the impatient: the sheet's FIRST open fetches
  `/api/style` and the file list before the presets, so the pane reads
  "Loading…" for a moment — that is not a hang. `/api/presets` answers in
  20ms from inside the app; a `curl` through `adb forward` does NOT reach it,
  which cost me a false alarm about the server.

## Saved appearances: the Presets row (2026-09-25, this session)

The user's feature, designed over four rounds of their questions and then
built: the whole Appearance sheet under a name, chosen from a row on the
panel, whose menu's last row saves what is on screen now (the group window's
"New Group" idiom, which is the one they asked for by name).

- **Server** (`looks.go`): `style/looks.json` holds `{current, looks:[…]}` -
  the reader's own looks and which one is in force. The three built-ins
  (Clean, Sepia, Old paper) come from the CODE, not the file: an app update
  can improve one without a migration, and a file cannot claim to be "Clean"
  and mean something else. Endpoints GET/POST/PUT/DELETE `/api/looks` and
  `/api/looks/apply`, all in openapi.yaml, plus `looks_test.go`.
- **A look is the whole state**: the size and the weight, the enabled layer
  ids, the backdrop and the reader's own sheets for BOTH themes, and the
  margins and bars. The built-in layers are stored as IDs and never as copies
  of their CSS, so a look saved today picks up tomorrow's "Sepia" instead of
  freezing the one it was saved against. The THEME is deliberately not part
  of a look: switching to one at night must not turn the lights on.
- **`/api/looks/apply` is two passes over one endpoint.** With `confirm`
  false it only ANSWERS - `needsConfirm` and which look is in force - and
  writes nothing, which is what makes it safe to ask on every switch. Every
  field counts in that comparison, the four sheets included. Re-applying the
  look already in force is never a question: that is "put it back how it was".
  With nothing in force the question is only "has the screen been changed at
  all", so a fresh install applying its first look is not nagged.
- **What the page sends** (`looks.js`, `looksNow()`): the shell's half of both
  themes - the colour, the wallpaper, the margins, the bars live in the
  shell's SharedPreferences, which this process cannot read - and the two text
  settings. The font numbers are there because of a bug found on the device:
  state.json is written on a 400ms debounce, so a reader who taps the stepper
  and switches a look in the same breath was compared against the size they
  had a moment before, and **the question about unsaved changes simply did not
  appear**. The caller's numbers decide the comparison only; what an apply
  writes is the LOOK's state.
- **The apply answer carries `fontSize`/`fontWeight` back** for the same
  reason in the other direction: the server's copy is a file, and neither the
  stepper nor the article's `--wd-fs` reads a file. Without it the look landed
  on disk and the page went on showing the old size.
- **Copy**: the Appearance sheet's door and its subject are `Style layers…`
  now (they were "Visual presets…" / "Presets"), because "presets" means the
  saved appearance from here on. The user chose that name when asked.
- **Verified on the emulator, end to end**: the row reads `Custom` with
  nothing in force and ticks nothing (see below); the saved look round-tripped
  a CSS marker, the size, both layer sets and both themes' wallpaper; the
  question showed the right branch - hidden "Update" for a built-in,
  `Update “devtest2”` for the reader's own; "Switch without saving" applied,
  "Cancel" changed nothing; the device was left exactly as it was found.
- **Two small things this cost, worth knowing**: a new web asset needs its own
  route in `routes.go` (`/assets/looks.js` - a 404 there means the script
  never runs and the row stays empty, which looks like a logic bug), and
  `screenChoice` had to learn -1 = "tick nothing", because ticking Clean while
  the row says Custom is two answers to one question.
- **Also fixed here, and it was not the feature's**: `TestOpenAPICoversEvery
  Route` had never worked on Windows. The spec is checked out with CRLF and a
  BLANK line there is one byte rather than none, so the scanner read the first
  blank line inside `paths:` as a top-level key, ended the block and found one
  operation out of forty - then reported every route as undocumented. One
  `strings.TrimSuffix(line, "\r")`. The gate now runs on this platform and it
  is what checked the new endpoints' entries.
- **Not done, deliberately**: deleting a look has an endpoint and no UI - the
  menu is exactly the list the user specified, with Save Current last - and
  the row does not mark itself "modified" after a change made by hand. The
  question at switch time is what protects the work; a marker is a nicety.

## Three fixes after the reader's report (2026-09-25, this session)

1. **Switching between Clean, Sepia and Old paper asked whether to save
   changes EVERY time** - the reader's report, and it was this code's bug.
   Two encodings were being compared as if they were two states:
   `fontSize`/`fontWeight` are stored with 0 meaning "the default" while the
   page normalises that to the number it draws with (15/400) and sends it back,
   and the shell keeps the last tone in its colour field even with the checkbox
   off while a look that names no colour stores "". So each built-in reported
   itself changed the moment it had been applied. Fixed in `lookDiffers`
   (`effectiveSize`/`effectiveWeight`, and `halfDiffers` ignores the colour
   while it is not in use), with the sibling fix in `lookIsCustomised` - which
   would have nagged the FIRST apply on a fresh install for the same reason.
   `TestLookSwitchBetweenBuiltinsNeverAsks` walks the reader's own loop, and
   the loop was driven on the device: four switches, no question, the row
   following each one.
2. **The shell now runs one navigation at a time** (`MainActivity.navigate`).
   A reload or a handed-over search arriving while a load is in flight used to
   start a second navigation, and the document in flight does not stop for it -
   a script cut off in the middle leaves every `let` below the cut
   uninitialised while the handlers that already ran keep calling them, which
   is a window that looks loaded and answers nothing. **Honest note: I could
   NOT reproduce that** (firing `EXTRA_RELOAD` at 0.4/1.2/2.2s after launch,
   no error), so this is insurance rather than a proven fix. Verified that it
   costs nothing: the page survives a reload fired during its load, and a
   reload fired while idle still reloads. The page-side watchdog the other
   agent suggested (reload once via a sessionStorage flag when boot does not
   finish) is deliberately NOT in: with a cause I cannot reproduce it would
   mask the next occurrence instead of fixing it. If the dead interface comes
   back, keep the FIRST console error rather than the last - the TDZ lines are
   the symptom, and the throw above them is the cause.
3. **`{{USERCSS}}` was substituted inside a JS comment** (index.html:1047). The
   server replaces every occurrence, and the text it puts there is generated
   `<link>` tags: harmless today, and one `*/` away from ending the comment
   early and killing the whole script - the real version of the failure above.
   The comment now says "the user-CSS slot in <head>" and the placeholder
   appears once, where it belongs.

## A preset's theme is its FILE NAME (2026-09-25, this session)

The reader's rule, and it is one rule rather than three: each file applies in
the theme its suffix names, and a file that is not there is empty. A preset
with a day half and no night half does NOTHING at night; one with both applies
in both, each half in its own theme; a preset that belongs to neither names the
SAME file in both slots, so "works in both themes" is written down.

- **Why this and not guards.** The guards inside the files were the whole class
  of bug, twice over: `sepia_article.css` had none, so a light preset's article
  half applied at night and Sepia's night was not Clean's; and
  `background_image_app.css` guarded its inks with `:not([data-theme="dark"])`
  - "the reader pinned dark by hand" - which is FALSE under Auto at night, so
  light inks landed on a dark page. That second one was my own Night-Day work,
  and I verified it then through `setTheme` (a pin, where the attribute IS set)
  and never through Auto. With the theme in the file name there is no guard to
  forget and no selector to get wrong.
- `preset` gained `AppNight`/`ArticleNight`; **`Theme` is DERIVED from the
  slots** (a manifest that declares one thing while its files do another is how
  high_contrast came to be offered at night while guarded to the day); the
  payload and the injected `<link>`s carry both halves, the night one marked
  `data-night`, and the page enables the half the RESOLVED theme applies -
  re-running on a theme switch (syncAutoDark) and at boot.
- **The radio rule is an INTERSECTION now, not equality**: `background` (both)
  and `sepia` (day) compete; `sepia` and `true_black` do not. Before, the first
  two could both be on and fight over `--bg`.
- Files: sepia and high_contrast are day-only; true_black and warm_dark are
  night-only (renamed `_night`); background is split into a day pair and a
  night pair, the night keeping only the theme-neutral surface rules. Every
  guard is gone from the preset CSS. `presets_test.go` guards the class: the
  manifest may not declare a theme, every named slot must be a file that is
  there, and the three derived themes must come out as expected.
- **Verified on the device**: with Sepia on, the light theme carries
  `sepia/day` and `presetArticleCSS` is 310 chars; at night there is NO preset
  link at all and the article CSS is 0 - the night is exactly Clean, which was
  the reader's original request. Switching back re-attaches it.
- Also fixed while in there: the enabled presets' ARTICLE halves were applied
  only after the Appearance sheet had been opened once, because `presetsLoad`
  ran from the sheet alone - a reader who never opened it got the layers in the
  chrome and none in the articles. It runs at boot now.

## The Presets row's button, and the editor's file line (2026-09-25)

- **The button** appears when the screen has drifted from the look in force:
  "Update current preset" when that look is the reader's own, "Save preset as
  new" when it is a built-in or nothing at all. It closes a real gap - before
  it, the only way to save your own tweaks into your own look was to try to
  switch away and catch the dialog. The answer comes from `/api/looks/apply`
  with `dry: true`, which reports and writes nothing (the same comparison the
  switch question runs), asked when the panel opens, after the panel's own
  changes, and when the sheet closes.
- **The editor says which file it is editing**, permanently: "Editing
  app_night.css - the night sheet" under the box, and a placeholder that names
  BOTH files and says plainly that they do not inherit from each other. The old
  hint was a static sentence claiming "the LIGHT theme's stylesheet" even while
  the box was editing the night one.
- **A note for the next agent, because it cost me a dead page twice**: patching
  this file with a script is a trap. `\n` inside a python heredoc came through
  as a real newline and broke every string literal it touched, which kills the
  whole inline script (every function then reports "not defined"); and a
  regex with DOTALL matched from one loop to another function's closing brace
  and silently deleted four functions. Write the file, then check with
  `grep -c` that the functions are still there and the page still boots.

## Two fixes on the Presets row (2026-09-25, from the reader)

- **The button is disabled, not hidden**, when the screen matches the look in
  force. Hidden was my first shape and it moved the drop-down beside it every
  time the reader touched a stepper - a control that comes and goes has to be
  found again. The label is the same whether or not there is anything to save
  (it names the ANSWER: "Update current preset" for the reader's own look,
  "Save preset as new" for a built-in or for nothing at all), and a disabled
  click does nothing. `.btn:disabled` is dimmed in app.css, the same idea as
  the font stepper's `.lim`.
- **A look applied AT NIGHT was writing its halves into the wrong slots.**
  `looksPushShell` walked `[[here, half.light], [!here, half.dark]]` - by the
  theme on screen - instead of each half into its own slot. So Sepia applied at
  night put its LIGHT half (colour enabled, #F4ECD8) into the NIGHT slot: the
  reader reported exactly that, "at night the Color checkbox is ticked in the
  Background tab", and the anti-clockwise half of the same bug put the night
  half into the day. Now `[[false, half.light], [true, half.dark]]`, and a look
  applied in either theme lands the same way.
- Verified on the device, in both directions: applied while the app was in the
  DARK theme, the light slot got `colorEnabled true` and the night slot
  `false` with the sheet's Color checkbox off and no background image - the
  night is Clean's, which is what the reader asked for from the start; applied
  in the day, the checkbox is on. Then the button: saving through it turns it
  disabled, a tap on the stepper turns it enabled, "Update current preset"
  folds the change in and disables it again.
- One thing worth knowing about the button: its state is only as fresh as the
  last check, and the check runs at three moments (the panel opening, a change
  the panel itself saved, the sheet closing). A change made while the panel is
  closed - only reachable through the sheet - is answered when the panel is
  opened, which is the moment the reader can see the button again.

## The Presets row, as the reader specified it (2026-09-25)

- **The bug behind "I switched to Clean and Save as was still active"**: the
  drift check ran BEFORE the page put the new state on itself. `looksApplied`
  drew the row (which asked) and only then pushed the shell's backdrop and the
  size and weight - so the server compared the OLD screen with the look that
  had just been applied and answered "changed" for a screen that already
  matched. The check is the LAST thing an apply does now, after the push, the
  font and the sheet reload; a load asks once the list is in, and nothing else
  asks on the reader's behalf.
- **The row has two buttons to the LEFT of the answer**, and the words say what
  the state is:

  | the screen | the drop-down | Save as… | Update |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | matches the look in force | the look's name | disabled | disabled (hidden for a built-in) |
  | changed, built-in in force | **Custom** | enabled | hidden |
  | changed, the reader's own look | the look's name | enabled | enabled |
  | nothing in force | Custom | enabled | hidden |

  "Custom" also means nothing is ticked in the menu: a tick on Clean beside the
  word Custom is two answers to one question. A built-in has no Update because
  a "Clean" that means something else is worse than no Clean at all, and the
  reader's own look keeps its NAME while it is changed - that is what makes
  "fold the change back into it" a thing they can do.
- Verified on the device, all four rows of that table: Clean applied from the
  menu → both disabled; a tap on the stepper → "Custom" with Save as… enabled
  and no Update; saved as a look → the name with both disabled; a tap → both
  enabled; Update → both disabled again.

## Sepia applied nothing at all (2026-09-25, from the reader)

"Sepia seems broken, and with the Window background Colour turned off it does
not work at all." Both true, and the cause was in my own split of the files.

- Their guards were `html:not([data-dark])` - a type selector plus an attribute,
  specificity (0,1,1). Stripping the guard left a bare `html`, (0,0,1), which
  LOSES to the `:root` (0,1,0) that app.css declares its palette on. Every token
  in the sheet was overruled, and the only sepia left on screen was the window
  colour - so switching that off made the preset do nothing at all.
- Fixed with `:root`: the same weight as the app's palette, so ORDER decides -
  which is exactly the layering the whole surface is built on (app.css, then
  the presets, then the reader's own sheet). `html:root` would have outranked
  the reader's sheet instead, the opposite of the promise.
- Four files: sepia_app, high_contrast_app, true_black_app_night,
  warm_dark_app_night. The background pair never had it - their selectors kept
  `html[data-shell-image]`, (0,1,1).
- Verified on the device: with Sepia on, `--bg`, `--bg-bar`, `--bg-card` and
  `--fg` are the preset's values, and they stay the preset's with the window
  colour switched off; the sheet parses (one rule), so it was specificity and
  not a broken file.
- **The lesson for whoever splits the next preset file**: what a guard is
  stripped off may be carrying specificity as well as meaning.

## The built-in is called Warm, and carries no window colour (2026-09-25)

Both asks came from one confusion: three things were called "sepia" - the
shell's window colour (`ShellPrefs.sepia`), the style layer in the pane, and
the saved look. The look is the one the reader wanted moved.

- **The look is "Warm"**; its ID stays `sepia` on purpose, so an install that
  has it in force keeps it across the rename (the id is never shown to anyone).
  The layer in the Style layers pane is still "Sepia" - that is upstream's name
  for the palette, and a CSS layer by that name confuses nobody; a THIRD thing
  wearing it was the problem.
- **The look no longer enables the window colour.** The palette IS the look:
  with the layer applied the page is warm on its own, and the window colour
  paints the window BEHIND the page - two different things that were doubling
  each other. It is also why the look appeared to do nothing with that colour
  switched off, which is what the reader reported a message earlier.
  `lookWarm`'s state is now `{Layers: ["sepia"]}` and nothing else.
- Verified: the tests assert Warm's light half carries no colour at all, and on
  the device the in-force look reads "Warm" with both buttons disabled - its ID
  unchanged, so the reader's state was not reset by the rename.

## The preset windows look like the app's other windows, and a look can go (2026-09-25)

- **The save window was not laid out as a form.** `#newGroupForm` carries
  `display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:.8em`; mine had no rule at all, so the
  label and the field shared a line and the field stretched across the card -
  which is exactly what the reader's screenshot showed. My form carries it now,
  and the three short windows (save, ask, delete) join the colour window in the
  phone breakpoint: `height:fit-content;margin:auto`. There is nothing in them
  to scroll, and stretching them to the full card is what made them look empty.
- **A look can be deleted.** The menu's last row is `Delete “Name”…`, and it
  exists ONLY while a look the reader owns is in force - the built-ins are the
  app's. It opens a window that names the look and says what it costs ("what is
  on screen stays as it is; only the saved preset goes"), then DELETEs it.
  Because that row is conditional, the two action rows' places are REMEMBERED
  when the labels are built (`looksSaveAt`/`looksDeleteAt`) rather than assumed
  to be last - the old `i === LOOK_LABELS.length - 1` would have opened the
  save dialog for a deleted look's slot.
- Verified on the device: the save window reads Name → field → Save/Cancel,
  compact and centred; the menu showed `… Save Current…, Delete “deltest”…` and
  the delete removed it, leaving the reader's own two looks (Rty, Clean+fw)
  untouched and the screen exactly as it was.

## The preset windows float over the page, and the row's buttons moved left (2026-09-25)

- **The three preset windows no longer paint the paper over the page.** The
  group dialogs' backdrop exists so a window LOOKS like it lies on the page's
  own background, and it does that by painting `--paper-bg` and the wallpaper
  across the app. Right for a list you came to edit; wrong for these, because
  what they are about IS the page - the reader is looking at the look they are
  saving, questioning or deleting. One rule, by id, so it beats both the plain
  and the shell-image backdrop rules:
  `#lookSaveDialog::backdrop,#lookAskDialog::backdrop,#lookDeleteDialog::backdrop{background:transparent}`.
- **The row's two buttons sit to the LEFT of the answer**, which is where the
  reader asked for them - my first version had them after it, and Update
  wrapped onto a second line. The answer's floor is 6.5em now instead of 9em,
  which is what lets the whole row fit one line on the phone: label 96,
  Save as… 80, Update 66, the look 85 - 32px high, one line, ending at 496 of
  the panel's 514.
- Verified on the device, both: the save window floats over a visible panel,
  and the row reads `Presets [Save as…] [Update] [Rty ▾]` with both buttons
  dimmed while the screen matches the look in force.

## The image rule was destroyed by the split's guard-stripping (2026-09-25)

The reader: "images no longer lose their white background in Old paper - this
block from article.css used to work". It did, until the split.

- The guard on those two selectors was `:host(:not([data-dark]))`, and the
  regex that strips guards matches the INNER part - `:not([data-dark])` -
  leaving `:host()` with empty parentheses. That is an INVALID selector, so the
  parser dropped the WHOLE rule: `background:transparent` and
  `mix-blend-mode:multiply`, in both rules that carry them.
- The other selector in each rule (`:root:not([data-dark]) > body img`) came out
  valid, but it cannot help: the article is a SHADOW ROOT, and `:root` inside
  one is the document root, which a shadow tree never matches. The rule was
  dead for the surface it was written for.
- Fixed by dropping the parentheses as well: `:host img`,
  `:host #ox-enlarge img:is(.thumb, .fullsize)`. The day file is only linked by
  day, so the guard it carried is exactly what the file slot says instead.
- **The lesson, and it is the second one from the same script-pass**: what
  comes out of a stripped guard may be syntactically INVALID (`:host()`), not
  merely weaker (`html` where `:root` was needed - the Sepia bug). After any
  such pass, fetch the served file and count what should be there:
  `mix-blend-mode` twice, `:host()` never. The whitespace-only lines the split
  left behind are tidied too.
- Verified on the device: the expanded Webster's article - one image, computed
  `mix-blend-mode: multiply`, `background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0)` - and the
  screenshot shows the illustration sitting ON the paper with its texture
  coming through, instead of in a white box.

## The preset row: the answer left, three icons right (2026-09-25, from the reader)

- The drop-down moved LEFT and the actions RIGHT, as icons: a floppy (save what
  is on screen as a new preset), an arrow onto a line (put what is on screen
  into this one) and a bin (delete). The words they would need are longer than
  the row has, and the drop-down beside them already names what they act on.
  Each carries a `title` AND an `aria-label` that say it in full, and the two
  that only work on a preset the reader owns say why they are inert:
  "Only a preset of your own can be updated".
- **Drawn, not emoji**, though the reader wrote them as emoji: emoji do not take
  `currentColor`, so they cannot follow the theme or the paper - the same reason
  the speak icons are drawn. 16px marks in a 32px button, because these are the
  only way to save, update or delete a preset and the row is 32px tall either
  way.
- **The arrow is not a circular one.** A refresh glyph was the reader's own
  first suggestion and they rejected it themselves: it reads as "reload", and
  this button writes what is on screen into the preset. A down arrow onto a
  baseline says "put it in" and nothing else.
- The menu's `Delete “Name”…` row is gone - the button replaces it - and the
  confirmation window (which names the preset and says what it costs) is the
  same one. Its flow was verified through the button: the window named "aaa"
  and Cancel left it alone.
- Verified on the device: one row, 32px tall, `Presets [aaa ▾] [disk] [↓] [bin]`,
  all three live for the reader's own preset, tooltips naming it.

## The Appearance rows hug their labels (2026-09-25, from the reader)

"Shift the controls as far left as they go - the block with Old paper next to
Presets, and the same for the steppers."

- The label column was 96px, copied from the reading strip so that the whole
  panel would share one column. It is 60px now: the width of the longest of the
  three names, "Font weight". The column is still ONE column - all three
  controls start at x=214 and the two steppers still line up with each other -
  it simply carries no slack. The slack was what the reader was objecting to; a
  shared column never was.
- The reading strip's pairs keep their 96px. Their labels are longer
  ("Highlight matches"), they are a different section, and that width is what
  makes the two columns the reader asked for THERE.
- Verified on the device: labels 60, all three controls at 214, and the row
  reads `Presets [Old paper ▾] [disk] [↓] [bin]` with the answer close enough to
  its word to read as one line.

## The 09-26 upstream sync into `dev2` (2026-09-26)

**Rechecked 2026-09-26:** `dev2` is at `f5b95d8`, the merge of upstream `master`
(`5f0ad02`) into it — five upstream commits: the index-version subsystem
(`0688c89`: `dict.ReaderVersion`, `store/fingerprint.go`, `store/stale.go`, the
`reindex` CLI and `/api/reindex`, the panel's Rebuild line, `ingest` defaulting
to the configured DICT_DIR), Browse triggering indexing (`95f0238`), and three
UI fixes (`78deb59` Group by, `17e730b` read-aloud icon, `fa83443` double
scrollbars). Two conflicts; both resolutions are in the merge message. The page
port is the shape to remember:

- index.html's 963-line "conflict" was upstream's inline stylesheet against our
  two `<link>`s (upstream has no `app.css` at all), and the remaining six hunks
  are the D149 picker-sections UI this fork never took — the same call as the
  09-25 sync. So: take OURS everywhere, then port upstream's deltas, CSS into
  `app.css` and JS/markup into the page. Ported: `.seg` scoped to `.bar` (top
  and phone query), the one-scrollbar lock (`html:has(#panel.show)` plus
  `--wd-sbw` measured in `showPanel`), `overscroll-behavior:contain`,
  `#speakBtn[aria-pressed="false"] .wave`, and the Rebuild line's markup with
  upstream's reindex JS verbatim — `renderReindex()` is called at the end of
  `renderPanel`, since the fork has no `syncPanelHeader`. Skipped: the
  `.chips`/`aria-pressed` rules and the `renderGroupSeg`/`CHECK_SVG` rework.
- Verified in a browser, not just by build: a throwaway server (isolated
  `USERPROFILE`, port 6899, pure-Go build) served the merged page, `loadDicts`
  filled the scope picker, and the new feature ran end to end — editing the
  source and pressing Rescan made the panel show "1 dictionary was prepared by
  an older version [Rebuild]", and Rebuild took `/api/reindex` to
  `{"done":1,"total":1}` and cleared the line.
- **`TestRescanSeesEditedSource` is a new known Windows failure** (upstream's own
  new test; it fails identically on clean `master`, so it is inherited rather
  than introduced). The live repro is "edit a dictionary source → Rescan
  folders → the page re-opens it": the implicit prepare cannot rename over
  text.db and the card shows `Access is denied`. The Rebuild button then fixes
  it, so the blast radius is that one path. Only the tag-less/pure-Go build
  could be tested here (no gcc) — the shipped cgo build is unverified.
- `merge-work/inline.go` needed a fix to run at all: its `pick.js` reference no
  longer matched the page (`?v={{PICKJS}}` arrived in the 09-23 merge). Fixed in
  the main checkout, and `index.full.html` regenerated from the merged page.

## Branch state — superseded snapshots

The 2026-09-20 opening of the branch-state section, and the rechecks the later
ones replaced. Kept for the record; what a reader wants is `HANDOFF.md`.

**2026-09-20, the file's original opening:**

Branch `dev` at merge commit `adb5507` (2026-09-20): upstream `master`
(wuweidict/wudict @ `312b88b` — Browse A-Z headword pages, state.json
dupes cleanup, accordion-clipping ResizeObserver fix, docs) merged into
`dev` and pushed. One conflict, `index.html` (the fork keeps styles in
`web/app.css`); resolution: fork structure + upstream's browseLink and
card-chip markup in index.html, the `.pd .acts a.browse` CSS into
app.css after `.pd .err`, ResizeObserver border-box fix stays in
index.html. Verified by a throwaway-worktree trial merge BEFORE the real
one: `go build`, `go vet`, store/dict green; server failures all from the
known Windows list. Note: `git worktree list` shows two unrelated codex
worktrees (`.codex/worktrees/…`) — not ours, left alone. A half-done
manual merge attempt (10 files deleted in the working tree, index
intact) was found and recovered with `git merge --abort` before redoing
the merge properly; nothing was lost.

**Rechecked 2026-09-21 (later session):** `dev` is at `653c36a` ("Merge
branch 'master' into dev"). The appearance-sheet work below is no longer
uncommitted — it is `f72bf04` "Appearence tab" on `Dictionary-Settings2`, and
`dev` contains it. The working tree is **not** clean, and what is in it is the
two newest pieces of work, each with its own section below: the Settings
drawer's five sections (stage 1) and the picker's single mode. Their files are
`internal/server/web/{index.html,app.css}`, `android/.../{Shell,ShellPrefs}.java`
and the two `docs/` UI notes — nothing else. One untracked directory is not
this work and was left alone: `.zcode/` (agent tooling — a plan file). It is not
ours to ship or delete.
Everything below those two sections is a historical snapshot, not current state.

Older appearance/presets/review notes below are historical.

**Rechecked 2026-09-22:** `dev` is at `09fd7ea` — the two pieces above are
committed, and the tree is clean again apart from one new uncommitted piece,
this session's icon change, plus the same untracked `.zcode/`.

**Rechecked 2026-09-23:** `dev` is at `8c50272`, the merge of upstream `master`
(`8b45514`) into `dev`. Trial-merged in a throwaway worktree
(`git worktree add … dev`), so the main checkout, which sits on `master`, was
never touched. `go build ./...` and `go vet ./...` clean — there is no `gcc`
here, so the tag-less/pure-Go path is what was built; `go test ./...` leaves
only the two known Windows failures below. Upstream's `fcd6edb` is a
cherry-pick of THIS branch's work with its own evolution on top, which is why
57 of its 72 files merged clean and the bounds tests came out byte for byte
ours; the 15 that needed a decision and how each was resolved are in the merge
commit's message. Three facts that are not derivable from the code:

**The third of the three facts** — the test count it mentions is superseded by
the known-failures list in `docs/WINDOWS-VERIFY.md`:

- **This merge is what takes `dev` from twelve failing tests on this machine to
  two.** The server resource/index, `dsl` and `lemmas` failures were upstream's
  fixes arriving, not something left to re-fix.

**Rechecked 2026-09-25** (superseded by the 09-26 rechecks):

**Rechecked 2026-09-25:** `dev` sits untouched at `e1304c9`; the upstream sync
went to the user's branch `dev2` instead, now at `024c4c1` — upstream master
(`69e73d1`+`e666d96`) merged per the user's decisions: the read-aloud feature
(speak) taken whole; upstream's configurable picker grouping (groupSeg/groupsOff)
NOT taken, the fork's dictionary groups stay; sortAZ/sortOwn picker sorting is
the fork's own feature; artifact names stay `wudict2-android-arm64-*.apk`.
Resolution trial-merged and verified first: build/vet green, tests green except
known-failing TestSetupFlow (fails on clean `dev` too). The upstream build was
also stood up for the user to evaluate on `http://127.0.0.1:6890` (temp db dir,
pure-Go build) — stop it when no longer needed.

## Pre-assessment branch snapshots (2026-09-29)

**Rechecked 2026-09-28 (the release was REPLACED):** `dev` is at `373273e`,
pushed, and the annotated tag `wudict2-v0.5.0` was MOVED onto it (`577c586` →
`373273e`) so the released v0.5.0 carries the night-preset fix instead of a new
tag following it. The release page was updated in place — new body, new APK
(versionCode 389, sha256 `1e8f0de9…`), the old asset deleted. The released build
is therefore the third session's five changes (the `Show info messages` row, the
page's top edge, the panel/status-bar moves, the notes' ink, the preset's paper
— `bef262d`, `7eb0e40`, `7be896e`, `3bfe24d`) PLUS the night-preset fix below.
`master` still has not moved since `5f0ad02`, so no upstream work is in it. On
this branch `test_data/` and `android/app/src/emuX86/jniLibs/` are ignored rather
than untracked, **and `dev` has moved since**: the `fonts-colour` work is
`70f8c78` and the branch now sits at `c7dd178`, the merge of
`Move-System-to-settings` (the shell's own settings moved into the page as the
System pane, with the Java side of that bridge). Two files are uncommitted at the
time of writing — `app.css` and `presets_test.go`, the System pane's label
register (see below).

**The picker's dropdown, the scope chip and the scope note all name what is
actually being searched (2026-09-28).** `scopedDictionary()` reads
`lastScope||$("dict").value` (label = the dictionary alone; naming its groups was
tried and dropped on the reader's word) and `lastScope` is cleared wherever the
answer is, so a view entered by following a `bword://` link no longer lists one
dictionary under a spinner saying "All dictionaries" — and "All dictionaries"
itself is now the way out of it. `scopeLabel()` asks the same function first, so
the chip (which lives in the status bar now) names the dictionary too, and
`searchScopeName()` gives the note's link and the automatic widening's note the
standing group's name instead of "all dictionaries", which was false whenever a
picker group was in force. Rules and reasons:
`docs/ANDROID-UI-HANDOFF.md` → "Dictionary groups: current work" → the bullets
"The dropdown names the dictionary the answer was scoped to" and "The scope note
names the group it will search".

**The third session's five changes (2026-09-27/28; committed `bef262d`,
`7eb0e40`, `7be896e`, `3bfe24d`; shipped in v0.5.0) — the `Show info messages`
row, the page's top edge, the panel/status-bar moves, the notes' ink and the
preset's paper — are written up in `docs/handoff-archive.md` as "The third
session: five changes…". The live rules they produced are in
`docs/ANDROID-UI-HANDOFF.md` → "Decisions to preserve".**

**GREY MEANS DISABLED, and the old hierarchy is a PRESET (`70f8c78`, merged as
`c7dd178`, unreleased):** labels, heads, hints and counts read `--label` /
`--label-quiet` (both defaulting to the ink), the greys are kept only for states,
and `presets/labels/quiet_labels_app.css` is the way back — on the three
standalone pages too, via the new `"pages": true` manifest field. On the phone.
Live rule: the area doc → "GREY MEANS DISABLED".

**Uncommitted on `dev` (2026-09-29): the System pane, and an appearance test
for the next one.** The merge's `#sysSettings` was written with `--fg-soft` on
its heads, hints, units and notes — grey in BOTH looks; all six read `--label`
now. Two guards cover the shape from here: `presets_test.go`'s
`TestGreyTextIsOnlyForDisabledStates` (a grey `color:` must be on an allow-listed
selector with a reason) and the new `appearance_contract_test.go:
TestAppearanceContract`, five checks over the served bytes — no unsubstituted
placeholder, the four-argument shell hook and the three page parameters, the
wallpaper/paper/register rules, text colours as tokens, and every bare `var(--x)`
declared. Its first run found four real defects (three literal `#c0564f` and the
shadow root's `a{color:#5b7a99}`), now tokens. **Not verified on a device** (a
static contract by design): the reader tests it.

**The night presets' palette fix (`6d7dc6a`, in the replaced v0.5.0)** is in the
area doc → "An app half must outrank the palette of the theme it is attached in".

Branch `master_build` (`0cc878c`, pushed): upstream `master` + the fork's
build system only — `build-android.cmd` adapted to master's
version-suffixed APK names (script computes `APK_VERSION` from git
describe, same sanitization as build.gradle's `apkVersion`), and
build.gradle carries the fork's `-PemuX86` debug-ABI support
(src/emuX86/jniLibs, debug-only). App identity stays upstream
(`com.legbehindneck.wudict`, port 6888), so builds from this branch are
the ORIGINAL product and install beside wuDict2. Verified:
`build-android.cmd debug intel` produced
`wudict-android-arm64-x86_64-foss-debug-<ver>.apk` with both ABIs.
Release signing reads the same untracked `build-android.local.bat` when
the MAIN checkout is switched to `master_build` (a worktree has no
local.bat — copy it there first). After each upstream `master` sync,
repeat this small overlay (two files) or merge `master` into
`master_build` when the naming/emuX86 code still applies.
