// Is this dictionary already in the library? (D134)
//
// The question is asked once, at sniff time, and its answer travels with the
// candidate so the user is told BEFORE choosing rather than shown a numbered
// folder afterwards. What the question is not: an audit of the library, a
// checksum, or a merge. It compares the folder an install would create against
// the folder that is there, by the one test the rest of this program already
// uses for "has this file changed" - size, with nothing hashed
// (store.SourceChanged, internal/store/library.go).
//
// Both possible mistakes are cheap by construction. A false "existing" offers
// a replacement of a folder that turns out to hold something else, which the
// user sees named and can untick; a false "not existing" installs beside it.

// markExisting annotates candidates with the library folder that already holds
// them. dest may be empty - a server with no dictionary folder configured -
// and then there is no folder to compare against.
//
// lib is the main file of every dictionary the library knows, in every
// configured folder. A candidate with no folder of its own in dest is looked
// up there BY NAME, whatever format or source that dictionary came from: the
// import folder is only the first configured folder, and a user who keeps
// "en-eu-Elhuyar.mdx" loose in another one must not be told a second copy is
// new and get one (D155 Am. 2).
