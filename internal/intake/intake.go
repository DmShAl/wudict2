// Package intake turns arbitrary bytes into candidate dictionaries.
//
// It is the stage in front of discovery, and it exists because of how these
// formats are actually distributed: as a .zip or .7z holding one or several
// dictionaries, each of which is a main file plus the companions it cannot
// work without. On a desktop that is a double-click and a drag; on a phone
// there is no comfortable way to unpack an archive into an app's own folder at
// all, which is the wall this removes.
//
// The division of labour with the rest of the tree:
//
//   - internal/dict discovers dictionaries that are ALREADY in place, and owns
//     the knowledge of which files make up one. This package borrows that
//     knowledge through dict.ClassifyName and dict.CompanionStem rather than
//     restating it, so an archive is grouped by exactly the rule a folder is.
//   - internal/store prepares a discovered dictionary into the library. This
//     package stops one step short of it: intake ends by putting files where a
//     rescan will find them, and preparation is then the ordinary path, under
//     the ordinary worker limits.
//
// Every input here is hostile by assumption. An archive is a list of names and
// declared sizes, all attacker-chosen: the names can climb out of the
// destination, the sizes can lie in either direction, and the entry count can
// be large enough to be the attack by itself. Nothing in this package trusts a
// declared value it has not also enforced while writing.
