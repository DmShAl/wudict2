// The location is not a temporary directory, and that is the whole point.
// Extraction ends in os.Rename, which is atomic only within one filesystem; a
// TMPDIR staging area would make every import a second full copy of itself,
// and on Android TMPDIR is the internal cache partition, so a 2 GB bundle
// would be both a cross-device copy AND an overflow of the wrong partition.
// Staging therefore sits inside the destination folder, where the rename is a
// directory entry being moved.

// It is hidden because dict.Discover skips hidden subtrees by rule: a scan
// racing an extraction must not offer a dictionary whose files are still
