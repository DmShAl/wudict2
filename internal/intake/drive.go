// Google Drive file links.
//
// What people share is the file's PAGE, drive.google.com/file/d/<id>/view: a
// viewer drawn by script, which holds neither the file nor a link to it. The
// file itself is served, without signing in, from
//
//	https://drive.usercontent.google.com/download?id=<id>&export=download&confirm=t
//
// which answers HEAD with the size and Last-Modified, GET with the real file
// name in Content-Disposition, and Range with 206 - everything a download
// here needs. confirm=t answers the "too large to scan for viruses" page Drive
// puts in front of big files.
//
// So a Drive link is rewritten once, in Check, and is from then on an ordinary
// download. Shared FOLDERS are not handled: their listing exists only behind
// the Drive API (which needs an API key) or undocumented pages.
//
// What is lost is the file name in the URL: every Drive download is called
// "download". Two places depend on a URL's name, and both are told about it:
// a download's resume and reuse records, which use the file id instead
// (partBase), and a collection, which learns the name from the server's
// answer to its HEAD (describe).

// ErrDriveRefused is Drive sending a page where the file should be: not
// shared with "anyone with the link", deleted, or over Drive's download quota
// for a popular file.
