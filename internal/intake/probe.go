// Finding the other half of a dictionary that was offered as several links.
//
// The sites these formats come from routinely publish "oxford.mdx" and
// "oxford.mdd" as two entries in one list, and a StarDict dictionary as three
// or four. A user who shares the first link has, from their point of view,
// shared the dictionary - so after the main file lands, the siblings dict's
// tables say it can have are LOOKED FOR at the same location, by name.
//
// Two rules keep this from being a crawler. Nothing is guessed that the format
// tables do not already name; and nothing is downloaded on the strength of a
// probe - what a probe produces is a list the user is shown and ticks, because
// a companion can be hundreds of megabytes on somebody's phone data, and
// fetching it because it happened to exist is a decision that is not ours to
// make.
//
// The probe itself is a HEAD, falling back to a one-byte ranged GET for the
// servers that refuse HEAD. Either way nothing but headers crosses the wire.

// maxProbes bounds the requests one import may spend looking. The alternative
// spellings of a StarDict index are the widest case in the tables and come to
// well under this; the number exists so that a format growing a long companion
// list cannot turn one import into a scan.
