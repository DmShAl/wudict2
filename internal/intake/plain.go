// A loose dictionary file, presented as a one-directory archive.
//
// The rest of this package is built around archives because that is how these
// formats are distributed - but it is not how they are always HANDED OVER. A
// link points at "oxford.mdx"; a share sheet carries one file; a download
// folder holds the .mdx and the .mdd side by side because the site offered
// them as two links. None of those is an archive, and all of them are a
// dictionary somebody is trying to install.
//
// Rather than a second pipeline for loose files, they enter the existing one
// through the Archive interface: a plainArchive lists the file the user named
// plus the siblings that belong to it, and everything downstream - the
// grouping rule, the completeness check, the "already installed" marking, the
// staging and the atomic rename - is the archive code, unchanged.
//
// The siblings are found by dict's own rule, the same one a folder scan uses:
// same directory, same stem. That is what makes an .mdx arrive with its .mdd
// instead of arriving as a dictionary with no images, and a StarDict .ifo
// arrive with the index without which it is a header describing nothing.

// maxPlainRes bounds the walk of a StarDict "res/" subtree. A resource folder
// is images and sounds and can honestly hold thousands; this is far above any
// of them and far below the point where walking is the cost.
const maxPlainRes = 20_000

// plainArchive is a real directory, filtered to one dictionary. Entry names
// are relative to that directory, so the candidate it produces is rooted
// exactly as one from a zip whose files sit at the archive root.

// OpenPlain presents the dictionary file at path, together with the files
// beside it that belong to the same dictionary, as an Archive.
//
// path may be the main file or one of its companions: a user who downloads
// "oxford.mdd" after "oxford.mdx" is handing over the SECOND half, and the
