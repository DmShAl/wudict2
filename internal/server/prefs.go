// StateFile holds the part of the UI that describes the COLLECTION rather than
// the browser looking at it: which dictionaries are searched, in what order,
// and how big their text is set (see UIPrefs). Everything that describes the
// browser instead - theme, wide mode, the last dictionary picked in the
// dropdown - stays in localStorage, where it belongs.
//
// The split is not cosmetic. localStorage is keyed by origin, so
// scheme://host:port is part of the identity: changing SERVER_PORT, reaching
// the same server as 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost, or opening it from a
// phone each hands the user a blank slate. Curating a hundred dictionaries and
// losing it to a port change is not a preference that survived, it is a
// preference that was never stored. The server, which owns the dictionaries,
// owns the answer to "which of them do I search".
//
// It lives beside the wudict.toml in effect rather than at a hardcoded path,
// so a portable install (D32) keeps its state on the same stick as its config,
// and --config points both at once. It is deliberately NOT inside the library
// folders: D20 defines those as individually transferable units, and "which
// dictionaries are enabled" is a fact about the set, not about any member.

// DictPref is one dictionary's remembered state. The path is what makes this
// survivable: ids are sha256(path)[:12] (see pathID), so moving a dictionary

// UIPrefs is the part of the reading experience that belongs to the PERSON
// rather than to the browser in front of them. The split at the top of this
// file sends theme and wide mode to localStorage because they are per-device
// view choices; text size is not one. A reader who needs 24px needs it on the
// phone that reaches this same server too, and localStorage — keyed by origin
// — would hand them 15px there, and again the first time SERVER_PORT changes.

	// half-written state.json cannot get wrong. An absent key is the feature
	// working, never the feature silently missing.
	//
	// It is remembered state for the UI, not an instruction to the server: the

	// reader's own order: the list they arranged is the answer to "which of
	// these do I want", and a race winner is not that answer. So an absent key
	// is the default strategy, which is the rule both flags obey - a
	// half-written state.json must not be able to invent a setting the user
	// never made.
	//

	// default - not that the word is always a negation.
	//
	// It reorders the picker and nothing else. The panel keeps listing the
	// user's own order whatever this says, because the panel is where that
	// order is EDITED by dragging, and a list that re-sorted itself
	// alphabetically under the drag could not express one. "All dictionaries"

	SpeakOff bool `json:"speakOff,omitempty"`

	// GroupsOff lists the picker sections the person has hidden, by facet id:
	// "lang", "pair", or a groups.ini section lower-cased (internal/facet).
	// Negated for the same reason as the flags above: every section the
	// library supports is shown unless the person said otherwise, and a facet
	// added tomorrow appears without a migration. Ids are kept opaque here - the server never groups anything,
	// and an id no facet uses any more simply hides nothing.

	// SortMine: the brief view is Lingvo's own default, so the zero value
