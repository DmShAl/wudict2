// Importing an archive over HTTP. internal/intake does the work; this file is
// the three requests a page makes of it, and one answer shape it polls.
//
// The split matters on Android, where this endpoint is the ONLY way a
// dictionary can arrive: the shell hands the server a path or a stream and has
// no unarchiver, no knowledge of formats, and no business acquiring one. The
// desktop page reaches the same three routes with a dropped file, so there is
// one import path on every platform rather than a shell feature the desktop
// build quietly lacks.
//
// None of these may answer cross-origin (D69): every one of them writes to the
// user's library, and the first names a path on their disk.

// maxIntakeUpload bounds a streamed archive. It is not a memory bound - the
// body is spooled to disk as it arrives and never held - but a bound on what a
// dropped connection can leave behind before the sweep notices, and a number
// that makes a mis-aimed upload fail while there is still room on the device.
// Dictionary bundles of several gigabytes are real, so it is generous.
