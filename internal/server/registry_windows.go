// releasePrepared hands back the prepared databases an ingest is about to
// replace. A rebuild ends in os.Rename over the existing text.db (and media
// packing over media.db), and Windows refuses a rename over an open file -
// SQLite opens without FILE_SHARE_DELETE - so a held database would otherwise
// burn a minutes-long rebuild at its very last step with "Access is denied".
// Where the rename is legal this is a no-op (registry_other.go) and the entry
// serves its prepared view mid-rebuild, exactly as before.
//
// The holder is whichever backend this entry currently serves, and it is not
// always the upgraded wrapper: dsl and bgl embed their own store (they are the
// formats that auto-prepare on first open). Closed outright, not after
// closeGrace - the grace exists for in-flight readers, and none of them can
// exist in a useful sense once the data they read is being replaced.
//
// With the backend gone, opens are barred for the length of the work
// (entry.rebuilding): a search landing mid-rebuild reports errReindexing
// instead of resolving the entry afresh and re-opening - and re-holding - the
// database about to be replaced. Every caller holds ingestMu, so the janitor
// cannot drop or reopen anything here either.

// releaseSuperseded closes, now, the backends this entry has retired and not
// yet closed. Two callers: an open that may re-prepare the dictionary in place,
// and a rescan letting go of an entry whose dictionary is gone.
//
// The second: the files of a prepared dsl dictionary are deleted, the rescan
// drops the entry, and its retired backend - dsl embeds its own store - keeps
// the library's text.db open through closeGrace. Removing that folder as an
// orphan in those seconds failed with "being used by another process". The
// entry has left the registry, so no request can still be reading through it.
//
// The first: the source is edited, a rescan sees it (revalidate) and retires
// the backend opened against the old edition, and the next open runs the
// format's own first-open ingest (dsl, bgl, wudict markdown), which ends in a
// rename over the text.db that retired backend still has open. Windows refuses
// that rename ("Access is denied"); rebuild never met it because it goes
// through releasePrepared, which closes the retired set first. Here nothing is
// lost by closing early: the entry is opening because it has no backend, so a
// retired one can only be serving a request that began before the change - on
// data that is being replaced.
