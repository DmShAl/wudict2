// here and is never capped again. It is off by default on the

// a startup into an hours-long, invisible re-index of everything. Here it is a
// drip: one dictionary at a time, deferred entirely while the process is not
// active, and each one attempted once per process.
//
// Only dictionaries whose companion is present on disk are swept. The reverse
// case - a companion deleted after it was absorbed - would cost a meta read per
// dictionary in the library to detect, and is caught by setFeatures the next
