// Saved appearances: one name for everything the Appearance sheet owns.
//
// That sheet now holds a whole look - the article's size and weight, which
// built-in preset layers are on, the window's colour and wallpaper per theme,
// what the screen margins and the bars do, and the reader's own stylesheets -
// and the only way back to a look that worked was to set every one of those
// again by hand. This is the name for it.
//
// Three things a look deliberately is NOT:
//
//   - Not a fifth stylesheet. The built-in layers are stored as the IDs that
//     are ON, never as copies of their CSS: those files are embedded in the
//     binary, so a look saved today picks up tomorrow's version of "Sepia"
//     instead of freezing the one it was saved against.
//   - Not per-theme. A look carries BOTH halves - a day colour and a night
//     colour, a day sheet and a night sheet - and never touches the theme
//     itself, because switching to a look at night must not turn the lights
//     on.
//   - Not the shell's own settings. The colour, the wallpaper, the margins and
//     the bars live in the Android shell's SharedPreferences, which this
//     process can neither read nor write. The page sends them in with every
//     request and pushes them back on apply; the server stores them opaquely
//     and compares them like any other field.
//
// State lives in style/looks.json, beside presets.json and the four
// stylesheets it speaks for: one folder, backed up as one piece.

// lookHalf is one theme's half: the window's backdrop and the reader's own
// sheet for it. The shell half of a request carries the backdrop fields and

// want, and answering it with a dialog would put a form in front of the one
