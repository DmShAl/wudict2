// Orphaned prepared dictionaries (D156).
//
// A prepared folder whose source has vanished is, for most users, not a copy
// they want: they keep their original dictionaries (other apps read those
// too), treat the library as a cache, and a folder they deleted by hand would
// leave gigabytes behind that nothing offers to remove. So an orphan is simply
// this: a healthy prepared folder whose
// recorded source is not on disk. No guessing about why - an unplugged drive
// and a deleted folder look the same, and the user, not the app, decides.
//
// Nothing here deletes on its own. The orphans are OFFERED (Rescan folders in
// the panel, `wudict clean -orphans`), and the user's two answers are recorded
// in the library itself:
//
//   - delete: RemoveOrphan, through RemovePrepared's single guard;
//   - keep:   `keep = standalone` in the folder's info.txt, after which the
//     folder is never offered again. Removing a dictionary's files from the
//     app while keeping its prepared data (D63 "dictionary files only") writes
//     the same line, because that act IS the decision to keep it standalone.
//
// A source that was only MOVED is not an orphan at all: Relink re-points the
// folder at it before anyone is asked.

// keepKey is the info.txt line that marks a folder as deliberately standalone.
