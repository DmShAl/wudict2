// A prepared dictionary is frozen output of the code that built it. When that
// code changes, the data on disk does not follow, and nothing about it fails:
// it keeps answering queries with whatever the old code wrote. The versions
// below are how the running code says what it would write now, and Stale is
// the one place that compares the two.
//
// Each stamp covers one layer, so a bump invalidates exactly what it changed:
//
//	ingest_version   this file's IngestPlan: the schema's use, StripHTML, the
//	                 alias and redirect rules, body normalization
//	reader_version   one format's Reader (dict.RegisterReaderVersion)
//	markup_version   internal/artmark's role vocabulary (MarkupStale)
//	fold_version     dict.Fold, persisted only in the trigram index (FoldStale)
//	media_version    IngestMedia
//
// A missing stamp means the database predates the stamp, and is read as
// version 1 - the behaviour in force when the stamp was introduced - so the
// day this ships does not declare an entire library outdated.
//
// Stale reports; it never rebuilds. Rebuilding costs minutes to hours on a
// large library and is started only by the user (wudict reindex, or the
// panel's Rebuild), never on anyone's behalf (docs.local/PERF.md).

// IngestVersion identifies IngestPlan's behaviour. Bump it in the same commit
// as any change to what an ingest writes for the same Reader output; the
// golden tests in the format packages fail on such a change and say so.
