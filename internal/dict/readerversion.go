// become entries, how a body is decoded, which headwords become aliases. The
// result is persisted in text.db, so a fix to a Reader reaches a library only
// through a rebuild - and nothing would say that one is due. The reader
// version is how the running code says so: each format registers the version
// of its Reader's behaviour, ingest records it (meta reader_version), and a
// prepared dictionary built by a different version is reported as outdated
// (store.Stale).
//
// Bump a format's version in the same commit as any change to what its Reader
// yields. The golden test in that format's package fails on such a change and
// names this function; the bump and the new golden go in together.
