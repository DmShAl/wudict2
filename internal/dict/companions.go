// A dictionary is rarely one file. MDX carries its resources in a sibling
// .mdd (possibly several, numbered); StarDict is an .ifo naming an .idx and a
// .dict.dz beside it, with an optional res/ folder; DSL keeps abbreviations in
// a _abrv file and media in a .files.zip. Two callers need to know which files
// belong to one dictionary - the panel, to show what a dictionary is made of,
// and removal (D63), to delete a dictionary without leaving its resources
// behind or taking a neighbour's with it - so the knowledge lives here once,
// beside the format registry, rather than in either caller.
//
// The rule that keeps this safe is the SHARED STEM: companions are named after
// the main file, and two dictionaries cannot share a stem in one folder
// without colliding on that name themselves. The two exceptions are named
// below and are why SourceFiles is presented to the user before anything is
// deleted rather than trusted silently.

// Stem returns the main file's path with its format suffix removed, which is
// what every companion is named after. ".dz" is stripped first, so "x.dsl.dz"
// and "x.dsl" both yield "x" - a compressed DSL's companions are named for the
// dictionary, not for the compression.
//
// Exported because the format packages resolve the same companions at READ
// time that this package resolves at removal time, and the two answering
// differently is how a dictionary comes to list media it will never serve.
