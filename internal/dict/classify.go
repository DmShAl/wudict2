// for the caller this exists for. An archive's central directory is a list of
// NAMES; there is no directory to stat until something has been extracted, and
// extracting first to find out whether it was worth extracting is exactly the
// cost intake exists to avoid. So this is the pure-name layer, added beside
// the stat-based one rather than replacing it - the two agree because they
// read the same tables (CompanionSuffixes, MediaSuffixes, abbrevSuffixes).
//
// What it is NOT is a probe. A file named ".mdx" that holds a photograph
// classifies as a main file here and fails when it is opened, which is the
// correct division of labour: a name is cheap and a format header is not.

// Kind is what a name looks like it is.
