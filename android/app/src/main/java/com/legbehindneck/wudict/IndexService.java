/**
 * Keeps the app alive while it is preparing a dictionary the user asked for.
 *
 * <p>This is the only Android mechanism in this app that changes the outcome of
 * a long ingest, and it is worth being precise about why the obvious ones do
 * not. Measured on the device this was written for: while indexing, the process
 * held 87% of 800% CPU with 626% <em>idle</em>, already in
 * {@code /dev/cpuset/top-app} with every core available, {@code schedtune.boost}
 * at 0 on every group, and two big cores isolated by {@code core_ctl} precisely
 * because nothing was loading them. There was no contention to win, so nothing
 * in the priority family - {@code setpriority}, {@code schedtune}, ADPF - had
 * anything to give. {@code setSustainedPerformanceMode} would have made it
 * worse: it <em>caps</em> clocks, being a thermal guarantee rather than a boost.
 *
 * <p>What actually kills a ten-minute ingest is the platform deciding the app
 * is idle: the freezer, and the low-memory killer, both of which read a
 * backgrounded app as a candidate. A {@code dataSync} foreground service is the
 * documented way to say "there is work in flight here", it works on every API
 * level this app supports, and it costs a notification the user can see and
 * dismiss the work from. That is the whole intervention.
 *
 * <p>From API 33 that notification is posted only if the user has allowed
 * notifications, and an app that never asks has the appop pinned to
 * {@code ignore}: the service comes up and the system drops every notification.
 * The protection is not affected - it comes from the service record, not the
 * shade - but the receipt would be invisible, so the ask happens at the one
 * moment it is meaningful ({@link Notif}).
 *
 * <p>Started and stopped from {@link ServerProcess}, off the server's own
 * "@wudict busy" markers: the server is an exec'd child (D52) and the only part
 * of this app that knows whether a person is waiting on an ingest right now.
 *
 * <h2>The three rules that make this safe</h2>
 *
 * <p><b>A start is debounced.</b> The server refcounts its markers around every
 * demanded ingest, including the ones that finish instantly - selecting an
 * already-prepared dictionary emits {@code busy 1} and {@code busy 0} 36 ms
 * apart. Arming a foreground service for that buys nothing and flashes a
 * notification at the user, so a start waits {@link #DEBOUNCE_MS} and is
 * cancelled outright if the work ends first. Nothing is at risk in that window:
 * the freezer and the low-memory killer act on minutes of apparent idleness,
 * not on a third of a second.
 *
 * <p><b>A stop never races the start.</b> Calling {@code stopService} on a
 * service that was started with {@code startForegroundService} but has not yet
 * reached {@code startForeground} is not a lost notification - it is
 * {@code ActiveServices.bringDownServiceLocked} killing the process with
 * {@code ForegroundServiceDidNotStartInTimeException}, unconditionally. So a
 * stop that arrives too early is recorded rather than performed, and the
 * service completes the contract and then stops itself.
 *
 * <p><b>Nothing brings the record down before it is foreground.</b> The same
 * applies to the service's own escape hatch: if {@code startForeground} throws,
 * {@code stopSelf} is not a retreat, it is the fatal call again from the other
 * side. Nor is giving up: a record that still owes the call is killed with
 * {@code RemoteServiceException} when the platform's window closes. So a
 * failure retries for as long as
 * the record exists, and the only ways out are succeeding and being destroyed.
 *
 * <p>Every call is fail-open. From API 31 a foreground service may not be
 * started while the app is in the background, which is a state this can legally
 * be reached from - a demanded ingest outlives the screen it was started from.
 * The throw is caught and the ingest simply runs unprotected.
