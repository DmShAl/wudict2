// It is flavour-NEUTRAL, unlike Storage, and that is the point of the file.
// Nothing here is a permission, a picker grant or a folder policy - it hands
// the server either a path or a stream of bytes and lets internal/intake do
// the rest, which is the same code the desktop page drives. So the FOSS
// flavour, which had no intake of any kind, gets exactly what the Play
// flavour gets, and neither has an unarchiver, a format table or an idea of
// what a dictionary is made of (D52: the shell absorbs the platform, the Go
// side owns the dictionary).
//
// The division with Storage/SafImporter is by CARGO, not by flavour: an
// archive comes here, a loose dictionary file or a picked folder stays with
// Storage. Each manifest filter therefore has exactly one handler -
// MainActivity tries this one first and falls through.
