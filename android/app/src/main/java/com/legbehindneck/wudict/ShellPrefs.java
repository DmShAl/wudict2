// SHELL FACTS: the fourth category of state in this project, and the only one
// that belongs to Java (D100).
//
// The other three are spoken for. Collection facts - which dictionaries are
// searched, in what order - live in the server's state.json. Install facts -
// folders, port, memory limits - live in wudict.toml, which this shell seeds
// once and never reads back (ServerProcess.seedConfig). Browser-view facts -
// theme, wide mode - live in the page's localStorage.
//
// A shell fact is none of those: it is about the Android shell's own
// behaviour, and two properties force it here rather than into any of them.
//
// It must be READABLE BY THE DECIDER AT DECISION TIME. LookupActivity chooses
// a window before ServerProcess.ensure() is even called, so there may be no
// server and no WebView: localStorage is unreachable by construction (it is
// keyed by origin and needs a live page), and a running server cannot be
// assumed.
//
// And it must be OWNED BY WHOEVER THE VALUE IS ABOUT. state.json is readable
// from Java - it is JSON, and Prefs.Replace writes it temp-file + rename, so a
// read cannot tear - but it is the SERVER's file: heal() rewrites it, Replace()
// is its only writer, and its `version` exists so a format change can be
// recognised rather than guessed at. Putting a value there that Go would never
// read turns every future change to that schema into a cross-language
// compatibility event, invisible from the Go side. A store whose owner never
// reads the value is the wrong store.
//
// SharedPreferences is the only store that passes both: same process as the
// decider, synchronous, no parse, no schema, no version negotiation, and a
// missing key is simply the default.
//
// ── PLATFORM OVERRIDES (D101) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The second half of this file stores a different kind of value: a Go config
// key whose right answer differs BECAUSE OF THIS DEVICE. It is still a shell
// fact - the device is the shell's subject - and it is still stored here, but
// it is DELIVERED into the config layering rather than read by Java.
//
// config.Load resolves every key as flag > env > file > default. The shell
// already writes the top two layers on every spawn, so an override rides a
// layer that OUTRANKS wudict.toml and never reads it: the rule that Java must
// not parse or rewrite the user's config file stands untouched, and nothing
// new had to be invented to keep it.
//
// Two states, never three. Set means "emit this value"; unset means "emit
// nothing", so the file and the built-in default decide. The shell never emits
// a NEGATING value, so a control on the settings screen can never silently
// countermand something the user wrote in wudict.toml themselves.
